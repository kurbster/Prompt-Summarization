Given a number $p$ and $n$ numbers $k_1, \ldots, k_n$, find p^{k_i}$ and divide that into two disjoint sets, minimizing the absolute difference between sums of numbers ineach set. Find the minimal absolute difference. Output the result modulo $10^{9}+7$.In the first test case of the example, there're the following numbers: $4$, $8$, $16$, $16$, and $8$. We can divide them into such two sets: ${4, 8, 16}$ and ${8, 16}$. Then the difference between the sums of numbers in sets would be $4$.Input:Input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains one integer $t$ $(1 \leq t \leq 10^5)$ — the number of test cases. Each test case is described as follows:The first line contains two integers $n$ and $p$ $(1 \leq n, p \leq 10^6)$. The second line contains $n$ integers $k_i$ $(0 \leq k_i \leq 10^6)$.The sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $10^6$.Output:Output one integer — the reminder of division the answer by $1\,000\,000\,007$.-----Example-----Input45 22 3 4 4 33 12 10 10004 50 1 1 1001 889Output41146981438747093407
