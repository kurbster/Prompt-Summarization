You are given two integers X and d.You should construct an array such that, removing all non-empty subsequences in which Maximum_element_of_the_subsequence  -  Minimum_element_of_subsequence  ≥ d from the set of allsubsequences will give you X subsequences.All the numbers in the final array should be positive integers less than 10^18. Note the number of elements in the output array should not be more than 10^4. If no answer is possible, print  - 1.In the output of the first example case, the remaining subsequences afterremoving those with Maximum_element_of_the_subsequence  -Minimum_element_of_subsequence  ≥ 5 are 5, 5, 7, 5, 6, 5, 7, 6, 50,7, 7, 6, 15, 6, 100. There are 10 of them. Hence, the array 5, 50,7, 15, 6, 100 is valid.  Similarly, in the output of the second example case, the remainingsub-sequences after removing those with Maximum_element_of_the_subsequence  -Minimum_element_of_subsequence  ≥ 2 are 10, 100, 1000, 10000. There are4 of them. Hence, the array 10, 100, 1000, 10000 is valid.Input:The only line of input consists of two space separated integers X and d (1 ≤ X, d ≤ 10^9).Output:Output should consist of two lines.First line should contain a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10 000)— the number of integers in the final array.Second line should consist of n space separated integers — a_1, a_2, ... , a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} < 10^18).If there is no answer, print a single integer -1. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.Examples:Input10 5Output65 50 7 15 6 100Input4 2Output410 100 1000 10000
