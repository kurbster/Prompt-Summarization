A known problem with some microphones is the “hissing s”. That is, sometimes the sound of the letter s is particularly pronounced; it stands out from the rest of the word in an unpleasant way.

Of particular annoyance are words that contain the letter s twice in a row. Words like amiss, kiss, mississippi and even hiss itself.

-----Input-----
The input contains a single string on a single line. This string consists of only lowercase letters (no spaces) and has between $1$ and $30$ characters.

-----Output-----
Output a single line. If the input string contains two consecutive occurrences of the letter s, then output hiss. Otherwise, output no hiss.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
amiss
Sample Output 1:
hiss

Sample Input 2:
octopuses
Sample Output 2:
no hiss
