There are N people living on a number line.
The i-th person lives at coordinate X_i.
You are going to hold a meeting that all N people have to attend.
The meeting can be held at any integer coordinate. If you choose to hold the meeting at coordinate P, the i-th person will spend (X_i - P)^2 points of stamina to attend the meeting.
Find the minimum total points of stamina the N people have to spend.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 100
 - 1 \leq X_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
X_1 X_2 ... X_N

-----Output-----
Print the minimum total stamina the N people have to spend.

-----Sample Input-----
2
1 4

-----Sample Output-----
5

Assume the meeting is held at coordinate 2. In this case, the first person will spend (1 - 2)^2 points of stamina, and the second person will spend (4 - 2)^2 = 4 points of stamina, for a total of 5 points of stamina. This is the minimum total stamina that the 2 people have to spend.
Note that you can hold the meeting only at an integer coordinate.
