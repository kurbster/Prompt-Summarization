Caracal is fighting with a monster.
The health of the monster is H.
Caracal can attack by choosing one monster. When a monster is attacked, depending on that monster's health, the following happens:
 - If the monster's health is 1, it drops to 0.
 - If the monster's health, X, is greater than 1, that monster disappears. Then, two new monsters appear, each with the health of \lfloor X/2 \rfloor.
(\lfloor r \rfloor denotes the greatest integer not exceeding r.)
Caracal wins when the healths of all existing monsters become 0 or below.
Find the minimum number of attacks Caracal needs to make before winning.
