Given are an integer N and arrays S, T, U, and V, each of length N.
Construct an N×N matrix a that satisfy the following conditions:
 - a_{i,j} is an integer.
 - 0 \leq a_{i,j}  \lt 2^{64}.
 - If S_{i} = 0, the bitwise AND of the elements in the i-th row is U_{i}.
 - If S_{i} = 1, the bitwise OR of the elements in the i-th row is U_{i}.
 - If T_{i} = 0, the bitwise AND of the elements in the i-th column is V_{i}.
 - If T_{i} = 1, the bitwise OR of the elements in the i-th column is V_{i}.
However, there may be cases where no matrix satisfies the conditions.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 -  1 \leq N \leq 500 
 -  0 \leq S_{i} \leq 1 
 -  0 \leq T_{i} \leq 1  
 -  0 \leq U_{i} \lt 2^{64}  
 -  0 \leq V_{i} \lt 2^{64}  

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S_{1} S_{2} ...  S_{N}
T_{1} T_{2} ...  T_{N}
U_{1} U_{2} ...  U_{N}
V_{1} V_{2} ...  V_{N}

-----Output-----
If there exists a matrix that satisfies the conditions, print one such matrix in the following format:
a_{1,1} ...  a_{1,N}
:
a_{N,1} ...  a_{N,N}

Note that any matrix satisfying the conditions is accepted.
If no matrix satisfies the conditions, print -1.

-----Sample Input-----
2
0 1
1 0
1 1
1 0

-----Sample Output-----
1 1
1 0

In Sample Input 1, we need to find a matrix such that:
 - the bitwise AND of the elements in the 1-st row is 1;
 - the bitwise OR of the elements in the 2-nd row is 1;
 - the bitwise OR of the elements in the 1-st column is 1;
 - the bitwise AND of the elements in the 2-nd column is 0.
