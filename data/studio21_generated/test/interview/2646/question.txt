There is a cave.
The cave has N rooms and M passages. The rooms are numbered 1 to N, and the passages are numbered 1 to M. Passage i connects Room A_i and Room B_i bidirectionally. One can travel between any two rooms by traversing passages. Room 1 is a special room with an entrance from the outside.
It is dark in the cave, so we have decided to place a signpost in each room except Room 1. The signpost in each room will point to one of the rooms directly connected to that room with a passage.
Since it is dangerous in the cave, our objective is to satisfy the condition below for each room except Room 1.
 - If you start in that room and repeatedly move to the room indicated by the signpost in the room you are in, you will reach Room 1 after traversing the minimum number of passages possible.
Determine whether there is a way to place signposts satisfying our objective, and print one such way if it exists.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq M \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 1 \leq A_i, B_i \leq N\ (1 \leq i \leq M)
 - A_i \neq B_i\ (1 \leq i \leq M)
 - One can travel between any two rooms by traversing passages.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
A_1 B_1
:
A_M B_M

-----Output-----
If there is no way to place signposts satisfying the objective, print No.
Otherwise, print N lines. The first line should contain Yes, and the i-th line (2 \leq i \leq N) should contain the integer representing the room indicated by the signpost in Room i.

-----Sample Input-----
4 4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 2

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

If we place the signposts as described in the sample output, the following happens:
 - Starting in Room 2, you will reach Room 1 after traversing one passage: (2) \to 1. This is the minimum number of passages possible.
 - Starting in Room 3, you will reach Room 1 after traversing two passages: (3) \to 2 \to 1. This is the minimum number of passages possible.
 - Starting in Room 4, you will reach Room 1 after traversing two passages: (4) \to 2 \to 1. This is the minimum number of passages possible.
Thus, the objective is satisfied.
