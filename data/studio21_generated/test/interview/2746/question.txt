Compare two version numbers version1 and version2.
If version1 > version2 return 1; if version1 < version2 return -1;otherwise return 0.

You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the . character.
The . character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate number sequences.
For instance, 2.5 is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it is the fifth second-level revision of the second first-level revision.

Example 1:


Input: version1 = "0.1", version2 = "1.1"
Output: -1

Example 2:


Input: version1 = "1.0.1", version2 = "1"
Output: 1

Example 3:


Input: version1 = "7.5.2.4", version2 = "7.5.3"
Output: -1
