Dreamoon likes to play with sets, integers and $gcd$. $\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)$ is defined as the largest positive integer that divides both a and b.

Let S be a set of exactly four distinct integers greater than 0. Define S to be of rank k if and only if for all pairs of distinct elements s_{i}, s_{j} from S, $\operatorname{gcd}(s_{i}, s_{j}) = k$.

Given k and n, Dreamoon wants to make up n sets of rank k using integers from 1 to m such that no integer is used in two different sets (of course you can leave some integers without use). Calculate the minimum m that makes it possible and print one possible solution.


-----Input-----

The single line of the input contains two space separated integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100).


-----Output-----

On the first line print a single integer — the minimal possible m. 

On each of the next n lines print four space separated integers representing the i-th set.

Neither the order of the sets nor the order of integers within a set is important. If there are multiple possible solutions with minimal m, print any one of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 1

Output
5
1 2 3 5

Input
2 2

Output
22
2 4 6 22
14 18 10 16



-----Note-----

For the first example it's easy to see that set {1, 2, 3, 4} isn't a valid set of rank 1 since $\operatorname{gcd}(2,4) = 2 \neq 1$.
