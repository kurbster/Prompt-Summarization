They say "years are like dominoes, tumbling one after the other". But would a year fit into a grid? I don't think so.

Limak is a little polar bear who loves to play. He has recently got a rectangular grid with h rows and w columns. Each cell is a square, either empty (denoted by '.') or forbidden (denoted by '#'). Rows are numbered 1 through h from top to bottom. Columns are numbered 1 through w from left to right.

Also, Limak has a single domino. He wants to put it somewhere in a grid. A domino will occupy exactly two adjacent cells, located either in one row or in one column. Both adjacent cells must be empty and must be inside a grid.

Limak needs more fun and thus he is going to consider some queries. In each query he chooses some rectangle and wonders, how many way are there to put a single domino inside of the chosen rectangle?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers h and w (1 ≤ h, w ≤ 500) – the number of rows and the number of columns, respectively.

The next h lines describe a grid. Each line contains a string of the length w. Each character is either '.' or '#' — denoting an empty or forbidden cell, respectively.

The next line contains a single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 100 000) — the number of queries.

Each of the next q lines contains four integers r1_{i}, c1_{i}, r2_{i}, c2_{i} (1 ≤ r1_{i} ≤ r2_{i} ≤ h, 1 ≤ c1_{i} ≤ c2_{i} ≤ w) — the i-th query. Numbers r1_{i} and c1_{i} denote the row and the column (respectively) of the upper left cell of the rectangle. Numbers r2_{i} and c2_{i} denote the row and the column (respectively) of the bottom right cell of the rectangle.


-----Output-----

Print q integers, i-th should be equal to the number of ways to put a single domino inside the i-th rectangle.
