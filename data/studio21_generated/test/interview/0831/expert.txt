 You are given n strings. You need to build string t such that: t is built from n strings. t is built from n strings. t is built from n strings. t is built from n strings. t is built from n strings. t is built from n strings. t is built from n strings. t is built from n strings. t is built from n strings. t is built from n strings. t is built from n strings. t is built from n strings. t is built from n strings. t is built from n strings. t is built from n strings. t is built from n strings. t is built from n strings. t is built from n strings. t is built from n strings. t is built from n strings. t is built from n strings. t is built from n strings. t is built from n strings. t is built
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains string t — the string that you need to build. The second line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of strings to which you are allowed to apply the described operation. Each of the next n lines contains a string and an integer. The i-th line contains space-separated string s_{i} and integer a_{i} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100). Number a_{i} represents the maximum number of characters that can be deleted from string s_{i}. All strings in the input only consist of lowercase English letters. All strings are non-empty. The lengths of all strings do not exceed 100 characters. -----Output----- Print a single number — the minimum money (in rubles) you need in order to build string t. If there is no solution, print -1. -----Examples----- Input bbaze 3 bzb 2 aeb 3 ba 10 Output 8 Input abacaba 4 aba 2 bcc 1 caa 2 bbb 5 Output 18 Input xyz 4 axx 8 za 1 efg 4 t 1 Output -1 -----Note----- Notes to the samples: In the first sample from the first string you should take characters "b" and "z" with price 1 ruble, from the second string characters "a", "e" и "b" with price 2 rubles. The price of the string t in this case is 2·1 + 3·2 = 8. In the second sample from the first string you should take two characters "a" with price 1 ruble, from the second string character "c" with price 2 rubles, from the third string two characters "a" with price 3 rubles, from the fourth string two characters "b" with price 4 rubles. The price of the string t in this case is 2·1 + 1·2 + 2·3 + 2·4 = 18. In the third sample the solution doesn't exist because there is no character "y" in given strings.
