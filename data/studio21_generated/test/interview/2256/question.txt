You are the gym teacher in the school.

There are $n$ students in the row. And there are two rivalling students among them. The first one is in position $a$, the second in position $b$. Positions are numbered from $1$ to $n$ from left to right.

Since they are rivals, you want to maximize the distance between them. If students are in positions $p$ and $s$ respectively, then distance between them is $|p - s|$. 

You can do the following operation at most $x$ times: choose two adjacent (neighbouring) students and swap them.

Calculate the maximum distance between two rivalling students after at most $x$ swaps.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains four integers $n$, $x$, $a$ and $b$ ($2 \le n \le 100$, $0 \le x \le 100$, $1 \le a, b \le n$, $a \neq b$) — the number of students in the row, the number of swaps which you can do, and positions of first and second rivaling students respectively.


-----Output-----

For each test case print one integer — the maximum distance between two rivaling students which you can obtain.


-----Example-----
Input
3
5 1 3 2
100 33 100 1
6 0 2 3

Output
2
99
1



-----Note-----

In the first test case you can swap students in positions $3$ and $4$. And then the distance between the rivals is equal to $|4 - 2| = 2$.

In the second test case you don't have to swap students. 

In the third test case you can't swap students.
