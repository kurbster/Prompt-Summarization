Vlad likes to eat in cafes very much. During his life, he has visited cafes n times. Unfortunately, Vlad started to feel that his last visits are not any different from each other. To fix that Vlad had a small research.

First of all, Vlad assigned individual indices to all cafes. Then, he wrote down indices of cafes he visited in a row, in order of visiting them. Now, Vlad wants to find such a cafe that his last visit to that cafe was before his last visits to every other cafe. In other words, he wants to find such a cafe that he hasn't been there for as long as possible. Help Vlad to find that cafe.


-----Input-----

In first line there is one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — number of cafes indices written by Vlad.

In second line, n numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 2·10^5) are written — indices of cafes in order of being visited by Vlad. Vlad could visit some cafes more than once. Note that in numeration, some indices could be omitted.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — index of the cafe that Vlad hasn't visited for as long as possible.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 3 2 1 2

Output
3

Input
6
2 1 2 2 4 1

Output
2



-----Note-----

In first test, there are three cafes, and the last visits to cafes with indices 1 and 2 were after the last visit to cafe with index 3; so this cafe is the answer. 

In second test case, there are also three cafes, but with indices 1, 2 and 4. Cafes with indices 1 and 4 were visited after the last visit of cafe with index 2, so the answer is 2. Note that Vlad could omit some numbers while numerating the cafes.
