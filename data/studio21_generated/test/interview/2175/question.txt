There is a system of n vessels arranged one above the other as shown in the figure below. Assume that the vessels are numbered from 1 to n, in the order from the highest to the lowest, the volume of the i-th vessel is a_{i} liters. [Image] 

Initially, all the vessels are empty. In some vessels water is poured. All the water that overflows from the i-th vessel goes to the (i + 1)-th one. The liquid that overflows from the n-th vessel spills on the floor.

Your task is to simulate pouring water into the vessels. To do this, you will need to handle two types of queries:  Add x_{i} liters of water to the p_{i}-th vessel;  Print the number of liters of water in the k_{i}-th vessel. 

When you reply to the second request you can assume that all the water poured up to this point, has already overflown between the vessels.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n — the number of vessels (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} — the vessels' capacities (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9). The vessels' capacities do not necessarily increase from the top vessels to the bottom ones (see the second sample). The third line contains integer m — the number of queries (1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5). Each of the next m lines contains the description of one query. The query of the first type is represented as "1 p_{i} x_{i}", the query of the second type is represented as "2 k_{i}" (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n, 1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ n).


-----Output-----

For each query, print on a single line the number of liters of water in the corresponding vessel.
