Dividing two numbers and computing the decimals is an extremely difficult task. Luckily, dividing a number by a “special” number is very easy (at least for us humans)!

We will define the set of “special” numbers $S=\{ 10^K\} $ for all non-negative integers $K$, i.e. $\{ 1,10,100,\ldots \} $.

Given a large numbers $N$ and a “special” large number $M$, what does the decimal representation of\[ \frac{N}{M} \]

look like?

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains 2 integers $N$, $M$, where $1\leq N, M\leq 10^{10^6}$, and $M\in S$.

-----Output-----
Print the exact decimal preresentation of $\frac{N}{M}$, i.e. every digit, without trailing zeroes; if the quotient is less than $1$, print one leading zero (see sample input).

-----Examples-----

92746237
