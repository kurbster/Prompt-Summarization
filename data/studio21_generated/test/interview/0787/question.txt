You are given a string q. A sequence of k strings s_1, s_2, ..., s_{k} is called beautiful, if the concatenation of these strings is string q (formally, s_1 + s_2 + ... + s_{k} = q) and the first characters of these strings are distinct.

Find any beautiful sequence of strings or determine that the beautiful sequence doesn't exist.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a positive integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 26) — the number of strings that should be in a beautiful sequence. 

The second line contains string q, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of the string is within range from 1 to 100, inclusive.


-----Output-----

If such sequence doesn't exist, then print in a single line "NO" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print in the first line "YES" (without the quotes) and in the next k lines print the beautiful sequence of strings s_1, s_2, ..., s_{k}.

If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
1
abca

Output
YES
abca

Input
2
aaacas

Output
YES
aaa
cas

Input
4
abc

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the second sample there are two possible answers: {"aaaca", "s"} and {"aaa", "cas"}.
