 Vasya has got three integers n, m and k. He wants to find three integer points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), such that 0 ≤ x1, x2, x3 ≤ n, 0 ≤ y1, y2, y3 ≤ m. Also, the area of the triangle formed by these points should be equal to n·m/k. Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. 
-----Input----- The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$). -----Output----- If there are no such points, print "NO". Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower). -----Examples----- Input 4 3 3 Output YES 1 0 2 3 4 1 Input 4 4 7 Output NO -----Note----- In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image]  In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
