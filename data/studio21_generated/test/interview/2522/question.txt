Given are two sequences A and B, both of length N.
A and B are each sorted in the ascending order.
Check if it is possible to reorder the terms of B so that for each i (1 \leq i \leq N) A_i \neq B_i holds, and if it is possible, output any of the reorderings that achieve it.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1\leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 1\leq A_i,B_i \leq N
 - A and B are each sorted in the ascending order.
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 \cdots A_N
B_1 B_2 \cdots B_N

-----Output-----
If there exist no reorderings that satisfy the condition, print No.
If there exists a reordering that satisfies the condition, print Yes on the first line.
After that, print a reordering of B on the second line, separating terms with a whitespace.
If there are multiple reorderings that satisfy the condition, you can print any of them.

-----Sample Input-----
6
1 1 1 2 2 3
1 1 1 2 2 3

-----Sample Output-----
Yes
2 2 3 1 1 1
