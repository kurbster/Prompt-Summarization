Twilight Sparkle once got a crystal from the Crystal Mine. A crystal of size n (n is odd; n > 1) is an n × n matrix with a diamond inscribed into it.

You are given an odd integer n. You need to draw a crystal of size n. The diamond cells of the matrix should be represented by character "D". All other cells of the matrix should be represented by character "*". Look at the examples to understand what you need to draw.


-----Input-----

The only line contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 101; n is odd). 


-----Output-----
