A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array) and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).

For a positive integer $n$, we call a permutation $p$ of length $n$ good if the following condition holds for every pair $i$ and $j$ ($1 \le i \le j \le n$) —   $(p_i \text{ OR } p_{i+1} \text{ OR } \ldots \text{ OR } p_{j-1} \text{ OR } p_{j}) \ge j-i+1$, where $\text{OR}$ denotes the bitwise OR operation. 

In other words, a permutation $p$ is good if for every subarray of $p$, the $\text{OR}$ of all elements in it is not less than the number of elements in that subarray. 

Given a positive integer $n$, output any good permutation of length $n$. We can show that for the given constraints such a permutation always exists.


-----Input-----

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first and only line of every test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$).


-----Output-----

For every test, output any good permutation of length $n$ on a separate line. 


-----Example-----
Input
3
1
3
7

Output
1
3 1 2
4 3 5 2 7 1 6



-----Note-----

For $n = 3$, $[3,1,2]$ is a good permutation. Some of the subarrays are listed below.   $3\text{ OR }1 = 3 \geq 2$ $(i = 1,j = 2)$  $3\text{ OR }1\text{ OR }2 = 3 \geq 3$ $(i = 1,j = 3)$  $1\text{ OR }2 = 3 \geq 2$ $(i = 2,j = 3)$  $1 \geq 1$ $(i = 2,j = 2)$ 

Similarly, you can verify that $[4,3,5,2,7,1,6]$ is also good.
