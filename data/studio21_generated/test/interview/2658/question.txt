The Kingdom of Takahashi has N towns, numbered 1 through N.
There is one teleporter in each town. The teleporter in Town i (1 \leq i \leq N) sends you to Town A_i.
Takahashi, the king, loves the positive integer K. The selfish king wonders what town he will be in if he starts at Town 1 and uses a teleporter exactly K times from there.
Help the king by writing a program that answers this question.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq N
 - 1 \leq K \leq 10^{18}

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
A_1 A_2 \dots A_N

-----Output-----
Print the integer representing the town the king will be in if he starts at Town 1 and uses a teleporter exactly K times from there.

-----Sample Input-----
4 5
3 2 4 1

-----Sample Output-----
4

If we start at Town 1 and use the teleporter 5 times, our travel will be as follows: 1 \to 3 \to 4 \to 1 \to 3 \to 4.
