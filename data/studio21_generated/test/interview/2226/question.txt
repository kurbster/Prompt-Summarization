You are given a simple weighted connected undirected graph, consisting of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges.

A path in the graph of length $k$ is a sequence of $k+1$ vertices $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_{k+1}$ such that for each $i$ $(1 \le i \le k)$ the edge $(v_i, v_{i+1})$ is present in the graph. A path from some vertex $v$ also has vertex $v_1=v$. Note that edges and vertices are allowed to be included in the path multiple times.

The weight of the path is the total weight of edges in it.

For each $i$ from $1$ to $q$ consider a path from vertex $1$ of length $i$ of the maximum weight. What is the sum of weights of these $q$ paths?

Answer can be quite large, so print it modulo $10^9+7$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a three integers $n$, $m$, $q$ ($2 \le n \le 2000$; $n - 1 \le m \le 2000$; $m \le q \le 10^9$) — the number of vertices in the graph, the number of edges in the graph and the number of lengths that should be included in the answer.

Each of the next $m$ lines contains a description of an edge: three integers $v$, $u$, $w$ ($1 \le v, u \le n$; $1 \le w \le 10^6$) — two vertices $v$ and $u$ are connected by an undirected edge with weight $w$. The graph contains no loops and no multiple edges. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a connected graph.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the sum of the weights of the paths from vertex $1$ of maximum weights of lengths $1, 2, \dots, q$ modulo $10^9+7$.

-----Note-----

Here is the graph for the first example: [Image] 

Some maximum weight paths are:   length $1$: edges $(1, 7)$ — weight $3$;  length $2$: edges $(1, 2), (2, 3)$ — weight $1+10=11$;  length $3$: edges $(1, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4)$ — weight $2+7+15=24$;  length $4$: edges $(1, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 4)$ — weight $2+7+15+15=39$;  $\dots$ 

So the answer is the sum of $25$ terms: $3+11+24+39+\dots$

In the second example the maximum weight paths have weights $4$, $8$, $12$, $16$ and $20$.
