We have a tree with N vertices numbered 1 to N.
The i-th edge in the tree connects Vertex u_i and Vertex v_i, and its length is w_i.
Your objective is to paint each vertex in the tree white or black (it is fine to paint all vertices the same color) so that the following condition is satisfied:
 - For any two vertices painted in the same color, the distance between them is an even number.
Find a coloring of the vertices that satisfies the condition and print it. It can be proved that at least one such coloring exists under the constraints of this problem.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq u_i < v_i \leq N
 - 1 \leq w_i \leq 10^9

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
u_1 v_1 w_1
u_2 v_2 w_2
.
.
.
u_{N - 1} v_{N - 1} w_{N - 1}

-----Output-----
Print a coloring of the vertices that satisfies the condition, in N lines.
The i-th line should contain 0 if Vertex i is painted white and 1 if it is painted black.
If there are multiple colorings that satisfy the condition, any of them will be accepted.

-----Sample Input-----
