There are N cards placed face down in a row. On each card, an integer 1 or 2 is written.
Let A_i be the integer written on the i-th card.
Your objective is to guess A_1, A_2, ..., A_N correctly.
You know the following facts:
 - For each i = 1, 2, ..., M, the value A_{X_i} + A_{Y_i} + Z_i is an even number.
You are a magician and can use the following magic any number of times:
Magic: Choose one card and know the integer A_i written on it. The cost of using this magic is 1.
What is the minimum cost required to determine all of A_1, A_2, ..., A_N?
It is guaranteed that there is no contradiction in given input.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq M \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq X_i < Y_i \leq N
 - 1 \leq Z_i \leq 100
 - The pairs (X_i, Y_i) are distinct.
 - There is no contradiction in input. (That is, there exist integers A_1, A_2, ..., A_N that satisfy the conditions.)

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
X_1 Y_1 Z_1
X_2 Y_2 Z_2
\vdots
X_M Y_M Z_M

-----Output-----
Print the minimum total cost required to determine all of A_1, A_2, ..., A_N.

-----Sample Input-----
3 1
1 2 1

-----Sample Output-----
2

You can determine all of A_1, A_2, A_3 by using the magic for the first and third cards.
