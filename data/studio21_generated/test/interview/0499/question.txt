Catherine has a deck of n cards, each of which is either red, green, or blue. As long as there are at least two cards left, she can do one of two actions:   take any two (not necessarily adjacent) cards with different colors and exchange them for a new card of the third color;  take any two (not necessarily adjacent) cards with the same color and exchange them for a new card with that color. 

She repeats this process until there is only one card left. What are the possible colors for the final card?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — the total number of cards.

The next line contains a string s of length n — the colors of the cards. s contains only the characters 'B', 'G', and 'R', representing blue, green, and red, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single string of up to three characters — the possible colors of the final card (using the same symbols as the input) in alphabetical order.

-----Note-----

In the first sample, Catherine has one red card and one blue card, which she must exchange for a green card.

In the second sample, Catherine has two green cards and one red card. She has two options: she can exchange the two green cards for a green card, then exchange the new green card and the red card for a blue card. Alternatively, she can exchange a green and a red card for a blue card, then exchange the blue card and remaining green card for a red card.

In the third sample, Catherine only has blue cards, so she can only exchange them for more blue cards.
