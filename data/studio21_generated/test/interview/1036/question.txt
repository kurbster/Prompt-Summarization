To decide which is the strongest among Rock, Paper, and Scissors, we will hold an RPS tournament.
There are 2^k players in this tournament, numbered 0 through 2^k-1. Each player has his/her favorite hand, which he/she will use in every match.
A string s of length n consisting of R, P, and S represents the players' favorite hands.
Specifically, the favorite hand of Player i is represented by the ((i\text{ mod } n) + 1)-th character of s; R, P, and S stand for Rock, Paper, and Scissors, respectively.
For l and r such that r-l is a power of 2, the winner of the tournament held among Players l through r-1 will be determined as follows:
 - If r-l=1 (that is, there is just one player), the winner is Player l.
 - If r-l\geq 2, let m=(l+r)/2, and we hold two tournaments, one among Players l through m-1 and the other among Players m through r-1. Let a and b be the respective winners of these tournaments. a and b then play a match of rock paper scissors, and the winner of this match - or a if the match is drawn - is the winner of the tournament held among Players l through r-1.
Find the favorite hand of the winner of the tournament held among Players 0 through 2^k-1.

-----Notes-----
 - a\text{ mod } b denotes the remainder when a is divided by b.
 - The outcome of a match of rock paper scissors is determined as follows:
 - If both players choose the same hand, the match is drawn;
 - R beats S;
 - P beats R;
 - S beats P.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq n,k \leq 100
 - s is a string of length n consisting of R, P, and S.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
n k
s

-----Output-----
Print the favorite hand of the winner of the tournament held among Players 0 through 2^k-1, as R, P, or S.

-----Sample Input-----
3 2
RPS

-----Sample Output-----
P

 - The favorite hand of the winner of the tournament held among Players 0 through 1 is P.
 - The favorite hand of the winner of the tournament held among Players 2 through 3 is R.
 - The favorite hand of the winner of the tournament held among Players 0 through 3 is P.
Thus, the answer is P.
