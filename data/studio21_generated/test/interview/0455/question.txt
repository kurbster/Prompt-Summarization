Snuke is introducing a robot arm with the following properties to his factory:
 - The robot arm consists of m sections and m+1 joints. The sections are numbered 1, 2, ..., m, and the joints are numbered 0, 1, ..., m. Section i connects Joint i-1 and Joint i. The length of Section i is d_i.
 - For each section, its mode can be specified individually. There are four modes: L, R, D and U. The mode of a section decides the direction of that section. If we consider the factory as a coordinate plane, the position of Joint i will be determined as follows (we denote its coordinates as (x_i, y_i)):
 - (x_0, y_0) = (0, 0).
 - If the mode of Section i is L, (x_{i}, y_{i}) = (x_{i-1} - d_{i}, y_{i-1}).
 - If the mode of Section i is R, (x_{i}, y_{i}) = (x_{i-1} + d_{i}, y_{i-1}).
 - If the mode of Section i is D, (x_{i}, y_{i}) = (x_{i-1}, y_{i-1} - d_{i}).
 - If the mode of Section i is U, (x_{i}, y_{i}) = (x_{i-1}, y_{i-1} + d_{i}).
Snuke would like to introduce a robot arm so that the position of Joint m can be matched with all of the N points (X_1, Y_1), (X_2, Y_2), ..., (X_N, Y_N) by properly specifying the modes of the sections.
Is this possible?
If so, find such a robot arm and how to bring Joint m to each point (X_j, Y_j).

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 1000
 - -10^9 \leq X_i \leq 10^9
 - -10^9 \leq Y_i \leq 10^9

-----Partial Score-----
 - In the test cases worth 300 points, -10 \leq X_i \leq 10 and -10 \leq Y_i \leq 10 hold.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
X_1 Y_1
X_2 Y_2
:
X_N Y_N

-----Output-----
If the condition can be satisfied, follow the following format. If the condition cannot be satisfied, print -1.
m
d_1 d_2 ... d_m
w_1
w_2
:
w_N

m and d_i are the configurations of the robot arm. Refer to the problem statement for what each of them means.
Here, 1 \leq m \leq 40 and 1 \leq d_i \leq 10^{12} must hold. Also, m and d_i must all be integers.
w_j is a string of length m that represents the way to bring Joint m of the robot arm to point (X_j, Y_j).
The i-th character of w_j should be one of the letters L, R, D and U, representing the mode of Section i.

-----Sample Input-----
3
-1 0
0 3
2 -1

-----Sample Output-----
2
1 2
RL

DR

In the given way to bring Joint m of the robot arm to each (X_j, Y_j), the positions of the joints will be as follows:
 - To (X_1, Y_1) = (-1, 0): First, the position of Joint 0 is (x_0, y_0) = (0, 0). As the mode of Section 1 is R, the position of Joint 1 is (x_1, y_1) = (1, 0). Then, as the mode of Section 2 is L, the position of Joint 2 is (x_2, y_2) = (-1, 0).
 - To (X_2, Y_2) = (0, 3): (x_0, y_0) = (0, 0), (x_1, y_1) = (0, 1), (x_2, y_2) = (0, 3).
 - To (X_3, Y_3) = (2, -1): (x_0, y_0) = (0, 0), (x_1, y_1) = (0, -1), (x_2, y_2) = (2, -1).
