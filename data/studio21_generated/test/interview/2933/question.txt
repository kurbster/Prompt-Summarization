Wallace the Weightlifting Walrus is training for a contest where it will have to lift $1000$ kg. Wallace has some weight plates lying around, possibly of different weights, and its goal is to add some of the plates to a bar so that it can train with a weight as close as possible to $1000$ kg.

In case there exist two such numbers which are equally close to $1000$ (e.g. $998$ and $1002$), Wallace will pick the greater one (in this case $1002$).

Help Wallace the Weightlifting Walrus and tell it which weight it will have to lift.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains the number of plates $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$). Each of the following $n$ lines contains one positive integer less than or equal to $1000$, denoting the weight of each plate.

-----Output-----
Output one integer, the combined weight closest to $1000$.

-----Examples-----
