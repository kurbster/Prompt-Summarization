We have a string S of length N consisting of A, T, C, and G.
Strings T_1 and T_2 of the same length are said to be complementary when, for every i (1 \leq i \leq l), the i-th character of T_1 and the i-th character of T_2 are complementary. Here, A and T are complementary to each other, and so are C and G.
Find the number of non-empty contiguous substrings T of S that satisfies the following condition:
 - There exists a string that is a permutation of T and is complementary to T.
Here, we distinguish strings that originate from different positions in S, even if the contents are the same.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 5000
 - S consists of A, T, C, and G.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N S

-----Output-----
Print the number of non-empty contiguous substrings T of S that satisfies the condition.

-----Sample Input-----
4 AGCT

-----Sample Output-----
2

The following two substrings satisfy the condition:
 - GC (the 2-nd through 3-rd characters) is complementary to CG, which is a permutation of GC.
 - AGCT (the 1-st through 4-th characters) is complementary to TCGA, which is a permutation of AGCT.
