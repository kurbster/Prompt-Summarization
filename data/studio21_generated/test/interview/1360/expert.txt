 You are given a student Valera who will take exams.  Valera takes exams on non-decreasing dates. Valera can take an exam for the i-th subject either on day a_{i}, or on day b_{i}. All the teachers put the record of the exam in the student's record book on the day of the actual exam and write down the date of the mark as number a_{i}. Valera believes that it would be rather strange if the entries in the record book did not go in the order of non-decreasing date. Therefore Valera asks you to help him. Find the minimum possible value of the day when Valera can take the final exam if he takes exams so that all the records in his record book go in the order of non-decreasing date. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) — the number of exams Valera will take. Each of the next n lines contains two positive space-separated integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ b_{i} < a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the date of the exam in the schedule and the early date of passing the i-th exam, correspondingly. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the minimum possible number of the day when Valera can take the last exam if he takes all the exams so that all the records in his record book go in the order of non-decreasing date. -----Examples----- Input 3 5 2 3 1 4 2 Output 2 Input 3 6 1 5 2 4 3 Output 6 -----Note----- In the first sample Valera first takes an exam in the second subject on the first day (the teacher writes down the schedule date that is 3). On the next day he takes an exam in the third subject (the teacher writes down the schedule date, 4), then he takes an exam in the first subject (the teacher writes down the mark with date 5). Thus, Valera takes the last exam on the second day and the dates will go in the non-decreasing order: 3, 4, 5. In the second sample Valera first takes an exam in the third subject on the fourth day. Then he takes an exam in the second subject on the fifth day. After that on the sixth day Valera takes an exam in the first subject.
