Polycarp has built his own web service. Being a modern web service it includes login feature. And that always implies password security problems.

Polycarp decided to store the hash of the password, generated by the following algorithm:  take the password $p$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and shuffle the letters randomly in it to obtain $p'$ ($p'$ can still be equal to $p$);  generate two random strings, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, $s_1$ and $s_2$ (any of these strings can be empty);  the resulting hash $h = s_1 + p' + s_2$, where addition is string concatenation. 

For example, let the password $p =$ "abacaba". Then $p'$ can be equal to "aabcaab". Random strings $s1 =$ "zyx" and $s2 =$ "kjh". Then $h =$ "zyxaabcaabkjh".

Note that no letters could be deleted or added to $p$ to obtain $p'$, only the order could be changed.

Now Polycarp asks you to help him to implement the password check module. Given the password $p$ and the hash $h$, check that $h$ can be the hash for the password $p$.

Your program should answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a non-empty string $p$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of $p$ does not exceed $100$.

The second line of each test case contains a non-empty string $h$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of $h$ does not exceed $100$.


-----Output-----

For each test case print the answer to it — "YES" if the given hash $h$ could be obtained from the given password $p$ or "NO" otherwise.


-----Example-----
Input
5
abacaba
zyxaabcaabkjh
onetwothree
threetwoone
one
zzonneyy
one
none
twenty
ten

Output
YES
YES
NO
YES
NO



-----Note-----

The first test case is explained in the statement.

In the second test case both $s_1$ and $s_2$ are empty and $p'=$ "threetwoone" is $p$ shuffled.

In the third test case the hash could not be obtained from the password.

In the fourth test case $s_1=$ "n", $s_2$ is empty and $p'=$ "one" is $p$ shuffled (even thought it stayed the same). 

In the fifth test case the hash could not be obtained from the password.
