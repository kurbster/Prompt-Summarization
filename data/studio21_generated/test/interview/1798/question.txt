One day Jeff got hold of an integer sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} of length n. The boy immediately decided to analyze the sequence. For that, he needs to find all values of x, for which these conditions hold:

  x occurs in sequence a.  Consider all positions of numbers x in the sequence a (such i, that a_{i} = x). These numbers, sorted in the increasing order, must form an arithmetic progression. 

Help Jeff, find all x that meet the problem conditions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The next line contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^5). The numbers are separated by spaces.


-----Output-----

In the first line print integer t — the number of valid x. On each of the next t lines print two integers x and p_{x}, where x is current suitable value, p_{x} is the common difference between numbers in the progression (if x occurs exactly once in the sequence, p_{x} must equal 0). Print the pairs in the order of increasing x.


-----Examples-----
Input
1
2

Output
1
2 0

Input
8
1 2 1 3 1 2 1 5

Output
4
1 2
2 4
3 0
5 0



-----Note-----

In the first test 2 occurs exactly once in the sequence, ergo p_2 = 0.
