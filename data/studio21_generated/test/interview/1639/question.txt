Kefa decided to make some money doing business on the Internet for exactly n days. He knows that on the i-th day (1 ≤ i ≤ n) he makes a_{i} money. Kefa loves progress, that's why he wants to know the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment in sequence a_{i}. Let us remind you that the subsegment of the sequence is its continuous fragment. A subsegment of numbers is called non-decreasing if all numbers in it follow in the non-decreasing order.

Help Kefa cope with this task!


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integers a_1,  a_2,  ...,  a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment of sequence a.


-----Examples-----
Input
6
2 2 1 3 4 1

Output
3
Input
3
2 2 9

Output
3


-----Note-----

In the first test the maximum non-decreasing subsegment is the numbers from the third to the fifth one.

In the second test the maximum non-decreasing subsegment is the numbers from the first to the third one.
