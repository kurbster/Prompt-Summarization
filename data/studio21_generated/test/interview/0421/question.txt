A restaurant received n orders for the rental. Each rental order reserve the restaurant for a continuous period of time, the i-th order is characterized by two time values — the start time l_{i} and the finish time r_{i} (l_{i} ≤ r_{i}).

Restaurant management can accept and reject orders. What is the maximal number of orders the restaurant can accept?

No two accepted orders can intersect, i.e. they can't share even a moment of time. If one order ends in the moment other starts, they can't be accepted both.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5) — number of orders. The following n lines contain integer values l_{i} and r_{i} each (1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ r_{i} ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print the maximal number of orders that can be accepted.
