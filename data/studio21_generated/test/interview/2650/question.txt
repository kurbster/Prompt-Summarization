There are N infants registered in AtCoder, numbered 1 to N, and 2\times 10^5 kindergartens, numbered 1 to 2\times 10^5.
Infant i has a rating of A_i and initially belongs to Kindergarten B_i.
From now on, Q transfers will happen.
After the j-th transfer, Infant C_j will belong to Kindergarten D_j.
Here, we define the evenness as follows. For each kindergarten with one or more infants registered in AtCoder, let us find the highest rating of an infant in the kindergarten. The evenness is then defined as the lowest among those ratings.
For each of the Q transfers, find the evenness just after the transfer.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N,Q \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq C_j \leq N
 - 1 \leq B_i,D_j \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - All values in input are integers.
 - In the j-th transfer, Infant C_j changes the kindergarten it belongs to.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N Q
A_1 B_1
A_2 B_2
:
A_N B_N
C_1 D_1
C_2 D_2
:
C_Q D_Q

-----Output-----
Print Q lines.
The j-th line should contain the evenness just after the j-th transfer.

Initially, Infant 1, 4 belongs to Kindergarten 1, Infant 2, 5 belongs to Kindergarten 2, and Infant 3, 6 belongs to Kindergarten 3.
After the 1-st transfer that makes Infant 4 belong to Kindergarten 3, Infant 1 belongs to Kindergarten 1, Infant 2, 5 belong to Kindergarten 2, and Infant 3, 4, 6 belong to Kindergarten 3. The highest ratings of an infant in Kindergarten 1, 2, 3 are 8, 6, 9, respectively. The lowest among them is 6, so the 1-st line in the output should contain 6.
After the 2-nd transfer that makes Infant 2 belong to Kindergarten 1, Infant 1, 2 belong to Kindergarten 1, Infant 5 belongs to Kindergarten 2, and Infant 3, 4, 6 belong to Kindergarten 3. The highest ratings of an infant in Kindergarten 1, 2, 3 are 8, 2, 9, respectively. The lowest among them is 2, so the 2-nd line in the output should contain 2.
After the 3-rd transfer that makes Infant 1 belong to Kindergarten 2, Infant 2 belongs to Kindergarten 1, Infant 1, 5 belong to Kindergarten 2, and Infant 3, 4, 6 belong to Kindergarten 3. The highest ratings of an infant in Kindergarten 1, 2, 3 are 6, 8, 9, respectively. The lowest among them is 6, so the 3-rd line in the output should contain 6.
