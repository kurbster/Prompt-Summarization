You are given integers N and M.
Consider a sequence a of length N consisting of positive integers such that a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_N = M. Find the maximum possible value of the greatest common divisor of a_1, a_2, ..., a_N.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - N \leq M \leq 10^9

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M

-----Output-----
Print the maximum possible value of the greatest common divisor of a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_N that satisfies the condition.

-----Sample Input-----
3 14

-----Sample Output-----
2

Consider the sequence (a_1, a_2, a_3) = (2, 4, 8). Their greatest common divisor is 2, and this is the maximum value.
