Genos needs your help. He was asked to solve the following programming problem by Saitama:

The length of some string s is denoted |s|. The Hamming distance between two strings s and t of equal length is defined as $\sum_{i = 1}^{|s|}|s_{i} - t_{i}|$, where s_{i} is the i-th character of s and t_{i} is the i-th character of t. For example, the Hamming distance between string "0011" and string "0110" is |0 - 0| + |0 - 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 0| = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.

Given two binary strings a and b, find the sum of the Hamming distances between a and all contiguous substrings of b of length |a|.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains binary string a (1 ≤ |a| ≤ 200 000).

The second line of the input contains binary string b (|a| ≤ |b| ≤ 200 000).

Both strings are guaranteed to consist of characters '0' and '1' only.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the sum of Hamming distances between a and all contiguous substrings of b of length |a|.


-----Examples-----
Input
01
00111

Output
3

Input
0011
0110

Output
2



-----Note-----

For the first sample case, there are four contiguous substrings of b of length |a|: "00", "01", "11", and "11". The distance between "01" and "00" is |0 - 0| + |1 - 0| = 1. The distance between "01" and "01" is |0 - 0| + |1 - 1| = 0. The distance between "01" and "11" is |0 - 1| + |1 - 1| = 1. Last distance counts twice, as there are two occurrences of string "11". The sum of these edit distances is 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3.

The second sample case is described in the statement.
