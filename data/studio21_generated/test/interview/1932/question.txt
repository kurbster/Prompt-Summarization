Anton's favourite geometric figures are regular polyhedrons. Note that there are five kinds of regular polyhedrons: 

  Tetrahedron. Tetrahedron has 4 triangular faces.  Cube. Cube has 6 square faces.  Octahedron. Octahedron has 8 triangular faces.  Dodecahedron. Dodecahedron has 12 pentagonal faces.  Icosahedron. Icosahedron has 20 triangular faces. 

All five kinds of polyhedrons are shown on the picture below:

Anton has a collection of n polyhedrons. One day he decided to know, how many faces his polyhedrons have in total. Help Anton and find this number!


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of polyhedrons in Anton's collection.

Each of the following n lines of the input contains a string s_{i} — the name of the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection. The string can look like this:

  "Tetrahedron" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is a tetrahedron.  "Cube" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is a cube.  "Octahedron" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is an octahedron.  "Dodecahedron" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is a dodecahedron.  "Icosahedron" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is an icosahedron. 


-----Output-----

Output one number — the total number of faces in all the polyhedrons in Anton's collection.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
Icosahedron
Cube
Tetrahedron
Dodecahedron

Output
42

Input
3
Dodecahedron
Octahedron
Octahedron

Output
28



-----Note-----

In the first sample Anton has one icosahedron, one cube, one tetrahedron and one dodecahedron. Icosahedron has 20 faces, cube has 6 faces, tetrahedron has 4 faces and dodecahedron has 12 faces. In total, they have 20 + 6 + 4 + 12 = 42 faces.
