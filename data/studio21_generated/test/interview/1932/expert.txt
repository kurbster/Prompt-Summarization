 Anton has a collection of polyhedrons.  One day he decided to know, how many faces his polyhedrons have in total. Help Anton and find this number! 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of polyhedrons in Anton's collection. Each of the following n lines of the input contains a string s_{i} — the name of the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection. The string can look like this:   "Tetrahedron" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is a tetrahedron.  "Cube" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is a cube.  "Octahedron" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is an octahedron.  "Dodecahedron" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is a dodecahedron.  "Icosahedron" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is an icosahedron.  -----Output----- Output one number — the total number of faces in all the polyhedrons in Anton's collection. -----Examples----- Input 4 Icosahedron Cube Tetrahedron Dodecahedron Output 42 Input 3 Dodecahedron Octahedron Octahedron Output 28 -----Note----- In the first sample Anton has one icosahedron, one cube, one tetrahedron and one dodecahedron. Icosahedron has 20 faces, cube has 6 faces, tetrahedron has 4 faces and dodecahedron has 12 faces. In total, they have 20 + 6 + 4 + 12 = 42 faces.
