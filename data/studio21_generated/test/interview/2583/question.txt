Ashishgup and FastestFinger play a game. 

They start with a number $n$ and play in turns. In each turn, a player can make any one of the following moves:  Divide $n$ by any of its odd divisors greater than $1$.  Subtract $1$ from $n$ if $n$ is greater than $1$. 

Divisors of a number include the number itself.

The player who is unable to make a move loses the game.

Ashishgup moves first. Determine the winner of the game if both of them play optimally.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 100$)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer  — $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^9$).


-----Output-----

For each test case, print "Ashishgup" if he wins, and "FastestFinger" otherwise (without quotes).


-----Example-----

Ashishgup



-----Note-----

In the first test case, $n = 1$, Ashishgup cannot make a move. He loses.

In the second test case, $n = 2$, Ashishgup subtracts $1$ on the first move. Now $n = 1$, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.

In the third test case, $n = 3$, Ashishgup divides by $3$ on the first move. Now $n = 1$, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.

In the last test case, $n = 12$, Ashishgup divides it by $3$. Now $n = 4$, FastestFinger is forced to subtract $1$, and Ashishgup gets $3$, so he wins by dividing it by $3$.
