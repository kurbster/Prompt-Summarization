While walking down the street Vanya saw a label "Hide&Seek". Because he is a programmer, he used & as a bitwise AND for these two words represented as a integers in base 64 and got new word. Now Vanya thinks of some string s and wants to know the number of pairs of words of length |s| (length of s), such that their bitwise AND is equal to s. As this number can be large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7.

To represent the string as a number in numeral system with base 64 Vanya uses the following rules:  digits from '0' to '9' correspond to integers from 0 to 9;  letters from 'A' to 'Z' correspond to integers from 10 to 35;  letters from 'a' to 'z' correspond to integers from 36 to 61;  letter '-' correspond to integer 62;  letter '_' correspond to integer 63. 


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains a single word s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100 000), consisting of digits, lowercase and uppercase English letters, characters '-' and '_'.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the number of possible pairs of words, such that their bitwise AND is equal to string s modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Examples-----

z

Output
3

130653412



-----Note-----

For a detailed definition of bitwise AND we recommend to take a look in the corresponding article in Wikipedia.

In the first sample, there are 3 possible solutions:   z&_ = 61&63 = 61 = z  _&z = 63&61 = 61 = z  z&z = 61&61 = 61 = z
