Akari has n kinds of flowers, one of each kind.
She is going to choose one or more of these flowers to make a bouquet.
However, she hates two numbers a and b, so the number of flowers in the bouquet cannot be a or b.
How many different bouquets are there that Akari can make?
Find the count modulo (10^9 + 7).
Here, two bouquets are considered different when there is a flower that is used in one of the bouquets but not in the other bouquet.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 2 \leq n \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq a < b \leq \textrm{min}(n, 2 \times 10^5)

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
n a b

-----Output-----
Print the number of bouquets that Akari can make, modulo (10^9 + 7). (If there are no such bouquets, print 0.)

-----Sample Input-----
4 1 3

-----Sample Output-----
7

In this case, Akari can choose 2 or 4 flowers to make the bouquet.
There are 6 ways to choose 2 out of the 4 flowers, and 1 way to choose 4, so there are a total of 7 different bouquets that Akari can make.
