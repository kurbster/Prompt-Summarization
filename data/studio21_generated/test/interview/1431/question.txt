There are N empty boxes arranged in a row from left to right.
The integer i is written on the i-th box from the left (1 \leq i \leq N).
For each of these boxes, Snuke can choose either to put a ball in it or to put nothing in it.
We say a set of choices to put a ball or not in the boxes is good when the following condition is satisfied:
 - For every integer i between 1 and N (inclusive), the total number of balls contained in the boxes with multiples of i written on them is congruent to a_i modulo 2.
Does there exist a good set of choices? If the answer is yes, find one good set of choices.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - a_i is 0 or 1.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
a_1 a_2 ... a_N

-----Output-----
If a good set of choices does not exist, print -1.
If a good set of choices exists, print one such set of choices in the following format:
M
b_1 b_2 ... b_M

where M denotes the number of boxes that will contain a ball, and b_1,\ b_2,\ ...,\ b_M are the integers written on these boxes, in any order.

-----Sample Input-----
3
1 0 0

-----Sample Output-----
1
1

Consider putting a ball only in the box with 1 written on it.
 - There are three boxes with multiples of 1 written on them: the boxes with 1, 2, and 3. The total number of balls contained in these boxes is 1.
 - There is only one box with a multiple of 2 written on it: the box with 2. The total number of balls contained in these boxes is 0.
 - There is only one box with a multiple of 3 written on it: the box with 3. The total number of balls contained in these boxes is 0.
Thus, the condition is satisfied, so this set of choices is good.
