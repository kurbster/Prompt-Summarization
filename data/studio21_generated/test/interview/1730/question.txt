You've got a undirected graph G, consisting of n nodes. We will consider the nodes of the graph indexed by integers from 1 to n. We know that each node of graph G is connected by edges with at least k other nodes of this graph. Your task is to find in the given graph a simple cycle of length of at least k + 1.

A simple cycle of length d (d > 1) in graph G is a sequence of distinct graph nodes v_1, v_2, ..., v_{d} such, that nodes v_1 and v_{d} are connected by an edge of the graph, also for any integer i (1 ≤ i < d) nodes v_{i} and v_{i} + 1 are connected by an edge of the graph.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, m, k (3 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of the nodes of the graph, the number of the graph's edges and the lower limit on the degree of the graph node. Next m lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers a_{i}, b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ n; a_{i} ≠ b_{i}) — the indexes of the graph nodes that are connected by the i-th edge. 

It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any multiple edges or self-loops. It is guaranteed that each node of the graph is connected by the edges with at least k other nodes of the graph.


-----Output-----

In the first line print integer r (r ≥ k + 1) — the length of the found cycle. In the next line print r distinct integers v_1, v_2, ..., v_{r} (1 ≤ v_{i} ≤ n) — the found simple cycle.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple correct answers, you are allowed to print any of them.
