You are looking at the floor plan of the Summer Informatics School's new building. You were tasked with SIS logistics, so you really care about travel time between different locations: it is important to know how long it would take to get from the lecture room to the canteen, or from the gym to the server room.

The building consists of n towers, h floors each, where the towers are labeled from 1 to n, the floors are labeled from 1 to h. There is a passage between any two adjacent towers (two towers i and i + 1 for all i: 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) on every floor x, where a ≤ x ≤ b. It takes exactly one minute to walk between any two adjacent floors of a tower, as well as between any two adjacent towers, provided that there is a passage on that floor. It is not permitted to leave the building.

The picture illustrates the first example. 

You have given k pairs of locations (t_{a}, f_{a}), (t_{b}, f_{b}): floor f_{a} of tower t_{a} and floor f_{b} of tower t_{b}. For each pair you need to determine the minimum walking time between these locations.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains following integers:

  n: the number of towers in the building (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^8),  h: the number of floors in each tower (1 ≤ h ≤ 10^8),  a and b: the lowest and highest floor where it's possible to move between adjacent towers (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ h),  k: total number of queries (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4). 

Next k lines contain description of the queries. Each description consists of four integers t_{a}, f_{a}, t_{b}, f_{b} (1 ≤ t_{a}, t_{b} ≤ n, 1 ≤ f_{a}, f_{b} ≤ h). This corresponds to a query to find the minimum travel time between f_{a}-th floor of the t_{a}-th tower and f_{b}-th floor of the t_{b}-th tower.


-----Output-----

For each query print a single integer: the minimum walking time between the locations in minutes.
