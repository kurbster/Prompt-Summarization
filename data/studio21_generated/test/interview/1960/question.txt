The next "Data Structures and Algorithms" lesson will be about Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS for short) of a sequence. For better understanding, Nam decided to learn it a few days before the lesson.

Nam created a sequence a consisting of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) elements a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^5). A subsequence a_{i}_1, a_{i}_2, ..., a_{i}_{k} where 1 ≤ i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_{k} ≤ n is called increasing if a_{i}_1 < a_{i}_2 < a_{i}_3 < ... < a_{i}_{k}. An increasing subsequence is called longest if it has maximum length among all increasing subsequences. 

Nam realizes that a sequence may have several longest increasing subsequences. Hence, he divides all indexes i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), into three groups: group of all i such that a_{i} belongs to no longest increasing subsequences. group of all i such that a_{i} belongs to at least one but not every longest increasing subsequence. group of all i such that a_{i} belongs to every longest increasing subsequence. 

Since the number of longest increasing subsequences of a may be very large, categorizing process is very difficult. Your task is to help him finish this job.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) denoting the number of elements of sequence a.

The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^5).


-----Output-----

Print a string consisting of n characters. i-th character should be '1', '2' or '3' depending on which group among listed above index i belongs to.

-----Note-----

In the second sample, sequence a consists of 4 elements: {a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4} = {1, 3, 2, 5}. Sequence a has exactly 2 longest increasing subsequences of length 3, they are {a_1, a_2, a_4} = {1, 3, 5} and {a_1, a_3, a_4} = {1, 2, 5}.

In the third sample, sequence a consists of 4 elements: {a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4} = {1, 5, 2, 3}. Sequence a have exactly 1 longest increasing subsequence of length 3, that is {a_1, a_3, a_4} = {1, 2, 3}.
