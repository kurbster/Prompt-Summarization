Takahashi has come to a party as a special guest.
There are N ordinary guests at the party. The i-th ordinary guest has a power of A_i.
Takahashi has decided to perform M handshakes to increase the happiness of the party (let the current happiness be 0).
A handshake will be performed as follows:
 - Takahashi chooses one (ordinary) guest x for his left hand and another guest y for his right hand (x and y can be the same).
 - Then, he shakes the left hand of Guest x and the right hand of Guest y simultaneously to increase the happiness by A_x+A_y.
However, Takahashi should not perform the same handshake more than once. Formally, the following condition must hold:
 - Assume that, in the k-th handshake, Takahashi shakes the left hand of Guest x_k and the right hand of Guest y_k. Then, there is no pair p, q (1 \leq p < q \leq M) such that (x_p,y_p)=(x_q,y_q).
What is the maximum possible happiness after M handshakes?

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq M \leq N^2
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^5
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
A_1 A_2 ... A_N

-----Output-----
Print the maximum possible happiness after M handshakes.

-----Sample Input-----
5 3
10 14 19 34 33

-----Sample Output-----
202

Let us say that Takahashi performs the following handshakes:
 - In the first handshake, Takahashi shakes the left hand of Guest 4 and the right hand of Guest 4.
 - In the second handshake, Takahashi shakes the left hand of Guest 4 and the right hand of Guest 5.
 - In the third handshake, Takahashi shakes the left hand of Guest 5 and the right hand of Guest 4.
Then, we will have the happiness of (34+34)+(34+33)+(33+34)=202.
We cannot achieve the happiness of 203 or greater, so the answer is 202.
