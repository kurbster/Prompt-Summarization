Vivek has encountered a problem. He has a maze that can be represented as an $n \times m$ grid. Each of the grid cells may represent the following:  Empty — '.'  Wall — '#'  Good person  — 'G'  Bad person — 'B' 

The only escape from the maze is at cell $(n, m)$.

A person can move to a cell only if it shares a side with their current cell and does not contain a wall. Vivek wants to block some of the empty cells by replacing them with walls in such a way, that all the good people are able to escape, while none of the bad people are able to. A cell that initially contains 'G' or 'B' cannot be blocked and can be travelled through.

Help him determine if there exists a way to replace some (zero or more) empty cells with walls to satisfy the above conditions.

It is guaranteed that the cell $(n,m)$ is empty. Vivek can also block this cell.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $t$ $(1 \le t \le 100)$ — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $m$ $(1 \le n, m \le 50)$ — the number of rows and columns in the maze.

Each of the next $n$ lines contain $m$ characters. They describe the layout of the maze. If a character on a line equals '.', the corresponding cell is empty. If it equals '#', the cell has a wall. 'G' corresponds to a good person and 'B' corresponds to a bad person.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print "Yes" if there exists a way to replace some empty cells with walls to satisfy the given conditions. Otherwise print "No"

You may print every letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Example-----

Output
Yes
Yes
No
No
Yes
Yes



-----Note-----

For the first and second test cases, all conditions are already satisfied.

For the third test case, there is only one empty cell $(2,2)$, and if it is replaced with a wall then the good person at $(1,2)$ will not be able to escape.

For the fourth test case, the good person at $(1,1)$ cannot escape.

For the fifth test case, Vivek can block the cells $(2,3)$ and $(2,2)$.

For the last test case, Vivek can block the destination cell $(2, 2)$.
