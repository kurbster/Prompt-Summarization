 You are given $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Each vertex must have degree $d$. Find a valid graph. 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($3 \leq n \leq 1\,000$) — the number of vertices. -----Output----- If there is no graph satisfying the conditions, print a single line containing the integer $-1$. Otherwise, first print a line containing a prime number $m$ ($2 \leq m \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$) — the number of edges in the graph. Then, print $m$ lines, the $i$-th of which containing two integers $u_i$, $v_i$ ($1 \leq u_i, v_i \leq n$) — meaning that there is an edge between vertices $u_i$ and $v_i$. The degree of each vertex must be prime. There must be no multiple (parallel) edges or self-loops. If there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them. Note that the graph can be disconnected. -----Examples----- Input 4 Output 5 1 2 1 3 2 3 2 4 3 4 Input 8 Output 13 1 2 1 3 2 3 1 4 2 4 1 5 2 5 1 6 2 6 1 7 1 8 5 8 7 8 -----Note----- The first example was described in the statement. In the second example, the degrees of vertices are $[7, 5, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3]$. Each of these numbers is prime. Additionally, the number of edges, $13$, is also a prime number, hence both conditions are satisfied. [Image]
