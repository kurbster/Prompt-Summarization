An altar enshrines N stones arranged in a row from left to right. The color of the i-th stone from the left (1 \leq i \leq N) is given to you as a character c_i; R stands for red and W stands for white.
You can do the following two kinds of operations any number of times in any order:
 - Choose two stones (not necessarily adjacent) and swap them.
 - Choose one stone and change its color (from red to white and vice versa).
According to a fortune-teller, a white stone placed to the immediate left of a red stone will bring a disaster. At least how many operations are needed to reach a situation without such a white stone?

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 200000
 - c_i is R or W.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
c_{1}c_{2}...c_{N}

-----Output-----
Print an integer representing the minimum number of operations needed.

-----Sample Input-----
4
WWRR

-----Sample Output-----
2

For example, the two operations below will achieve the objective.
 - Swap the 1-st and 3-rd stones from the left, resulting in RWWR.
 - Change the color of the 4-th stone from the left, resulting in RWWW.
