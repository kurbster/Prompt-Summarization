Shaass has decided to hunt some birds. There are n horizontal electricity wires aligned parallel to each other. Wires are numbered 1 to n from top to bottom. On each wire there are some oskols sitting next to each other. Oskol is the name of a delicious kind of birds in Shaass's territory. Supposed there are a_{i} oskols sitting on the i-th wire. $40$ 

Sometimes Shaass shots one of the birds and the bird dies (suppose that this bird sat at the i-th wire). Consequently all the birds on the i-th wire to the left of the dead bird get scared and jump up on the wire number i - 1, if there exists no upper wire they fly away. Also all the birds to the right of the dead bird jump down on wire number i + 1, if there exists no such wire they fly away. 

Shaass has shot m birds. You're given the initial number of birds on each wire, tell him how many birds are sitting on each wire after the shots.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains an integer n, (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The next line contains a list of space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100). 

The third line contains an integer m, (0 ≤ m ≤ 100). Each of the next m lines contains two integers x_{i} and y_{i}. The integers mean that for the i-th time Shaass shoot the y_{i}-th (from left) bird on the x_{i}-th wire, (1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_{i}). It's guaranteed there will be at least y_{i} birds on the x_{i}-th wire at that moment.


-----Output-----

On the i-th line of the output print the number of birds on the i-th wire.
