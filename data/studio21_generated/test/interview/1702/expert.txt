 You are given n participants, including Vasya and Petya. For each participant and each problem, the number of minutes which passed between the beginning of the contest and the submission of this participant to this problem is known. It's also possible that this participant made no submissions to this problem. With two seconds until the end of the round, all participants' submissions have passed pretests, and not a single hack attempt has been made. Vasya believes that no more submissions or hack attempts will be made in the remaining two seconds, and every submission will pass the system testing. Unfortunately, Vasya is a cheater. He has registered 10^9 + 7 new accounts for the round. Now Vasya can submit any of his solutions from these new accounts in order to change the maximum point values of the problems. Vasya can also submit any wrong solutions to any problems. Note that Vasya can not submit correct solutions to the problems he hasn't solved. Vasya seeks to score strictly more points than Petya in the current round. Vasya has already prepared the scripts which allow to obfuscate his solutions and submit them into the system from any of the new accounts in just fractions of seconds. However, Vasya doesn't want to make his cheating too obvious, so he wants to achieve his goal while making submissions from the smallest possible number of new accounts. Find the smallest number of new accounts Vasya
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 120) — the number of round participants, including Vasya and Petya. Each of the next n lines contains five integers a_{i}, 1, a_{i}, 2..., a_{i}, 5 ( - 1 ≤ a_{i}, j ≤ 119) — the number of minutes passed between the beginning of the round and the submission of problem j by participant i, or -1 if participant i hasn't solved problem j. It is guaranteed that each participant has made at least one successful submission. Vasya is listed as participant number 1, Petya is listed as participant number 2, all the other participants are listed in no particular order. -----Output----- Output a single integer — the number of new accounts Vasya needs to beat Petya, or -1 if Vasya can't achieve his goal. -----Examples----- Input 2 5 15 40 70 115 50 45 40 30 15 Output 2 Input 3 55 80 10 -1 -1 15 -1 79 60 -1 42 -1 13 -1 -1 Output 3 Input 5 119 119 119 119 119 0 0 0 0 -1 20 65 12 73 77 78 112 22 23 11 1 78 60 111 62 Output 27 Input 4 -1 20 40 77 119 30 10 73 50 107 21 29 -1 64 98 117 65 -1 -1 -1 Output -1 -----Note----- In the first example, Vasya's optimal strategy is to submit the solutions to the last three problems from two new accounts. In this case the first two problems will have the maximum point value of 1000, while the last three problems will have the maximum point value of 500. Vasya's score will be equal to 980 + 940 + 420 + 360 + 270 = 2970 points, while Petya will score just 800 + 820 + 420 + 440 + 470 = 2950 points. In the second example, Vasya has to make a single unsuccessful submission to any problem from two new accounts, and a single successful submission to the first problem from the third new account. In this case, the maximum point values of the problems will be equal to 500, 1500, 1000, 1500, 3000. Vasya will score 2370 points, while Petya will score just 2294 points. In the third example, Vasya can achieve his goal by submitting the solutions to the first four problems from 27 new accounts. The maximum point values of the problems will be equal to 500, 500, 500, 500, 2000. Thanks to the high cost of the fifth problem, Vasya will manage to beat Petya who solved the first four problems very quickly, but couldn't solve the fifth one.
