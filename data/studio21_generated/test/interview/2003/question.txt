Author has gone out of the stories about Vasiliy, so here is just a formal task description.

You are given q queries and a multiset A, initially containing only integer 0. There are three types of queries:  "+ x" — add integer x to multiset A. "- x" — erase one occurrence of integer x from multiset A. It's guaranteed that at least one x is present in the multiset A before this query. "? x" — you are given integer x and need to compute the value $\operatorname{max}_{y \in A}(x \oplus y)$, i.e. the maximum value of bitwise exclusive OR (also know as XOR) of integer x and some integer y from the multiset A.

Multiset is a set, where equal elements are allowed.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 200 000) — the number of queries Vasiliy has to perform.

Each of the following q lines of the input contains one of three characters '+', '-' or '?' and an integer x_{i} (1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 10^9). It's guaranteed that there is at least one query of the third type.

Note, that the integer 0 will always be present in the set A.


-----Output-----

For each query of the type '?' print one integer — the maximum value of bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) of integer x_{i} and some integer from the multiset A.


-----Example-----
Input
10
+ 8
+ 9
+ 11
+ 6
+ 1
? 3
- 8
? 3
? 8
? 11

Output
11
10
14
13



-----Note-----

After first five operations multiset A contains integers 0, 8, 9, 11, 6 and 1.

The answer for the sixth query is integer $11 = 3 \oplus 8$ — maximum among integers $3 \oplus 0 = 3$, $3 \oplus 9 = 10$, $3 \oplus 11 = 8$, $3 \oplus 6 = 5$ and $3 \oplus 1 = 2$.
