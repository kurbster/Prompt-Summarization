The Queen of England has n trees growing in a row in her garden. At that, the i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ n) tree from the left has height a_{i} meters. Today the Queen decided to update the scenery of her garden. She wants the trees' heights to meet the condition: for all i (1 ≤ i < n), a_{i} + 1 - a_{i} = k, where k is the number the Queen chose.

Unfortunately, the royal gardener is not a machine and he cannot fulfill the desire of the Queen instantly! In one minute, the gardener can either decrease the height of a tree to any positive integer height or increase the height of a tree to any positive integer height. How should the royal gardener act to fulfill a whim of Her Majesty in the minimum number of minutes?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated integers: n, k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 1000). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000) — the heights of the trees in the row. 


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single integer p — the minimum number of minutes the gardener needs. In the next p lines print the description of his actions. 

If the gardener needs to increase the height of the j-th (1 ≤ j ≤ n) tree from the left by x (x ≥ 1) meters, then print in the corresponding line "+ j x". If the gardener needs to decrease the height of the j-th (1 ≤ j ≤ n) tree from the left by x (x ≥ 1) meters, print on the corresponding line "- j x".

If there are multiple ways to make a row of trees beautiful in the minimum number of actions, you are allowed to print any of them.
