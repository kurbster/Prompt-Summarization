Given are a prime number p and a sequence of p integers a_0, \ldots, a_{p-1} consisting of zeros and ones.
Find a polynomial of degree at most p-1, f(x) = b_{p-1} x^{p-1} + b_{p-2} x^{p-2} + \ldots + b_0, satisfying the following conditions:
 - For each i (0 \leq i \leq p-1), b_i is an integer such that 0 \leq b_i \leq p-1.
 - For each i (0 \leq i \leq p-1), f(i) \equiv a_i \pmod p.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq p \leq 2999
 - p is a prime number.
 - 0 \leq a_i \leq 1

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
p
a_0 a_1 \ldots a_{p-1}

-----Output-----
Print b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_{p-1} of a polynomial f(x) satisfying the conditions, in this order, with spaces in between.
It can be proved that a solution always exists. If multiple solutions exist, any of them will be accepted.

-----Sample Input-----
2
1 0

-----Sample Output-----
1 1

f(x) = x + 1 satisfies the conditions, as follows:
 - f(0) = 0 + 1 = 1 \equiv 1 \pmod 2
 - f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2 \equiv 0 \pmod 2
