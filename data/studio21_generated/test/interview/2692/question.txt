Given $N$ and $B$, help Chef find out the minimum number of cookies he must initially bake, $A$, to satisfy his hunger.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of  two space separated integers $N, B$. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, print a single integer $A$, the minimum number of cookies Chef must bake initially.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000000000$
- $2 \leq B \leq 1000000000$
