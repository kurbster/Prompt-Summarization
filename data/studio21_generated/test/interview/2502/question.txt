Given are two strings s and t consisting of lowercase English letters. Determine if the number of non-negative integers i satisfying the following condition is finite, and find the maximum value of such i if the number is finite.
 - There exists a non-negative integer j such that the concatenation of i copies of t is a substring of the concatenation of j copies of s.

-----Notes-----
 - A string a is a substring of another string b if and only if there exists an integer x (0 \leq x \leq |b| - |a|) such that, for any y (1 \leq y \leq |a|), a_y = b_{x+y} holds.
 - We assume that the concatenation of zero copies of any string is the empty string. From the definition above, the empty string is a substring of any string. Thus, for any two strings s and t, i = 0 satisfies the condition in the problem statement.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq |s| \leq 5 \times 10^5
 - 1 \leq |t| \leq 5 \times 10^5
 - s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
s
t

-----Output-----
If the number of non-negative integers i satisfying the following condition is finite, print the maximum value of such i; if the number is infinite, print -1.

-----Sample Input-----
abcabab
ab

-----Sample Output-----
3

The concatenation of three copies of t, ababab, is a substring of the concatenation of two copies of s, abcabababcabab, so i = 3 satisfies the condition.
On the other hand, the concatenation of four copies of t, abababab, is not a substring of the concatenation of any number of copies of s, so i = 4 does not satisfy the condition.
Similarly, any integer greater than 4 does not satisfy the condition, either. Thus, the number of non-negative integers i satisfying the condition is finite, and the maximum value of such i is 3.
