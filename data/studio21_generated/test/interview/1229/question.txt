You have multiset of n strings of the same length, consisting of lowercase English letters. We will say that those strings are easy to remember if for each string there is some position i and some letter c of the English alphabet, such that this string is the only string in the multiset that has letter c in position i.

For example, a multiset of strings {"abc", "aba", "adc", "ada"} are not easy to remember. And multiset {"abc", "ada", "ssa"} is easy to remember because:   the first string is the only string that has character c in position 3;  the second string is the only string that has character d in position 2;  the third string is the only string that has character s in position 2. 

You want to change your multiset a little so that it is easy to remember. For a_{ij} coins, you can change character in the j-th position of the i-th string into any other lowercase letter of the English alphabet. Find what is the minimum sum you should pay in order to make the multiset of strings easy to remember.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 20) — the number of strings in the multiset and the length of the strings respectively. Next n lines contain the strings of the multiset, consisting only of lowercase English letters, each string's length is m.

Next n lines contain m integers each, the i-th of them contains integers a_{i}1, a_{i}2, ..., a_{im} (0 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ 10^6).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the answer to the problem.
