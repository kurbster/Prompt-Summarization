Let quasi-palindromic number be such number that adding some leading zeros (possible none) to it produces a palindromic string. 

String t is called a palindrome, if it reads the same from left to right and from right to left.

For example, numbers 131 and 2010200 are quasi-palindromic, they can be transformed to strings "131" and "002010200", respectively, which are palindromes.

You are given some integer number x. Check if it's a quasi-palindromic number.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). This number is given without any leading zeroes.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if number x is quasi-palindromic. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
131

Output
YES

Input
320

Output
NO

Input
2010200
