While resting on the ship after the "Russian Code Cup" a boy named Misha invented an interesting game. He promised to give his quadrocopter to whoever will be the first one to make a rectangular table of size n × m, consisting of positive integers such that the sum of the squares of numbers for each row and each column was also a square.

Since checking the correctness of the table manually is difficult, Misha asks you to make each number in the table to not exceed 10^8.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100)  — the size of the table. 


-----Output-----

Print the table that meets the condition: n lines containing m integers, separated by spaces. If there are multiple possible answers, you are allowed to print anyone. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one correct answer.
