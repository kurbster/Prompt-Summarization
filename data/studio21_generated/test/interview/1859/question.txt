You are given an integer number $n$. The following algorithm is applied to it:

  if $n = 0$, then end algorithm;  find the smallest prime divisor $d$ of $n$;  subtract $d$ from $n$ and go to step $1$. 

Determine the number of subtrations the algorithm will make.


-----Input-----

The only line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^{10}$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the number of subtractions the algorithm will make.


-----Examples-----
Input
5

Output
1

Input
4

Output
2



-----Note-----

In the first example $5$ is the smallest prime divisor, thus it gets subtracted right away to make a $0$.

In the second example $2$ is the smallest prime divisor at both steps.
