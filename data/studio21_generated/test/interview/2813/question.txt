A haiku is a Japanese form of poetry. It consists of three phrases of $5$, $7$ and $5$ syllables each.

Once a year, HiQ has a haiku contest, where employees submit their best poems. The poems are then judged based on a wide range of aspects, such as
 - creativity
 - simplicity
 - beauty
 - whether the poem is actually a haiku

This last point turned out to be quite a challenge for the judges (many problems arose when half the judges indexed syllables starting at $0$ and the other half at $1$).

Can you help the judges to determine whether a submitted poem is a haiku, given a set of syllables? Note that there may exist multiple decompositions of a single word in the poem into syllables. In this case, you should determine whether some decomposition is a haiku.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains a single integer $1 \le S \le 100$, the number of syllables. The next line contains $S$ words separated by spaces (the syllables). Each syllable contains at most $7$ lowercase letters a-z.

Then, three lines containing the poem follow. Each line contains a (non-empty) list of words separated by spaces, representing a phrase. The words contain only lowercase letters a-z. The length of each line is at most $100$ characters (including spaces).

It is guaranteed that there exists at least one decomposition of the poem into the given syllables.

-----Output-----
Output “haiku” if the given poem is a haiku, and “come back next year” otherwise (without the quotes).

-----Explanation of Sample Input 1-----
One possible decomposition into a haiku is:

spe-lling ve-ry hard
ear-ly in mor-ning ti-red
i need cov-fe-fe


-----Explanation of Sample Input 3-----
No matter how the third line is decomposed, it contains $8$ syllables instead of $5$, so it can not be a haiku.
