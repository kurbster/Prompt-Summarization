Eugeny has array a = a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, consisting of n integers. Each integer a_{i} equals to -1, or to 1. Also, he has m queries:  Query number i is given as a pair of integers l_{i}, r_{i} (1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ r_{i} ≤ n).  The response to the query will be integer 1, if the elements of array a can be rearranged so as the sum a_{l}_{i} + a_{l}_{i} + 1 + ... + a_{r}_{i} = 0, otherwise the response to the query will be integer 0. 

Help Eugeny, answer all his queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (a_{i} = -1, 1). Next m lines contain Eugene's queries. The i-th line contains integers l_{i}, r_{i} (1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ r_{i} ≤ n).


-----Output-----

Print m integers — the responses to Eugene's queries in the order they occur in the input.
