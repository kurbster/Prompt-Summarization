DZY loves collecting special strings which only contain lowercase letters. For each lowercase letter c DZY knows its value w_{c}. For each special string s = s_1s_2... s_{|}s| (|s| is the length of the string) he represents its value with a function f(s), where $f(s) = \sum_{i = 1}^{|s|}(w_{s_{i}} \cdot i)$

Now DZY has a string s. He wants to insert k lowercase letters into this string in order to get the largest possible value of the resulting string. Can you help him calculate the largest possible value he could get? 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^3).

The second line contains a single integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^3).

The third line contains twenty-six integers from w_{a} to w_{z}. Each such number is non-negative and doesn't exceed 1000.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the largest possible value of the resulting string DZY could get.


-----Examples-----
Input
abc
3
1 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Output
41



-----Note-----

In the test sample DZY can obtain "abcbbc", value = 1·1 + 2·2 + 3·2 + 4·2 + 5·2 + 6·2 = 41.
