Let S be the concatenation of 10^{10} copies of the string 110. (For reference, the concatenation of 3 copies of 110 is 110110110.)
We have a string T of length N.
Find the number of times T occurs in S as a contiguous substring.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - T is a string of length N consisting of 0 and 1.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
T

-----Output-----
Print the number of times T occurs in S as a contiguous substring.

-----Sample Input-----
4
1011

-----Sample Output-----
9999999999

S is so long, so let us instead count the number of times 1011 occurs in the concatenation of 3 copies of 110, that is, 110110110. We can see it occurs twice:
 - 1 1011 0110
 - 1101 1011 0
