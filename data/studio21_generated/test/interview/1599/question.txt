Ilya the Lion wants to help all his friends with passing exams. They need to solve the following problem to pass the IT exam.

You've got string s = s_1s_2... s_{n} (n is the length of the string), consisting only of characters "." and "#" and m queries. Each query is described by a pair of integers l_{i}, r_{i} (1 ≤ l_{i} < r_{i} ≤ n). The answer to the query l_{i}, r_{i} is the number of such integers i (l_{i} ≤ i < r_{i}), that s_{i} = s_{i} + 1.

Ilya the Lion wants to help his friends but is there anyone to help him? Help Ilya, solve the problem.


-----Input-----

The first line contains string s of length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). It is guaranteed that the given string only consists of characters "." and "#".

The next line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) — the number of queries. Each of the next m lines contains the description of the corresponding query. The i-th line contains integers l_{i}, r_{i} (1 ≤ l_{i} < r_{i} ≤ n).


-----Output-----

Print m integers — the answers to the queries in the order in which they are given in the input.
