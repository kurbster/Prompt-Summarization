There are N points on the 2D plane, i-th of which is located on (x_i, y_i).
There can be multiple points that share the same coordinate.
What is the maximum possible Manhattan distance between two distinct points?
Here, the Manhattan distance between two points (x_i, y_i) and (x_j, y_j) is defined by |x_i-x_j| + |y_i-y_j|.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 1 \leq x_i,y_i \leq 10^9
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
x_1 y_1
x_2 y_2
:
x_N y_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.

-----Sample Input-----
3
1 1
2 4
3 2

-----Sample Output-----
4

The Manhattan distance between the first point and the second point is |1-2|+|1-4|=4, which is maximum possible.
