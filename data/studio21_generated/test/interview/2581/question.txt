Gargari is jealous that his friend Caisa won the game from the previous problem. He wants to prove that he is a genius.

He has a n × n chessboard. Each cell of the chessboard has a number written on it. Gargari wants to place two bishops on the chessboard in such a way that there is no cell that is attacked by both of them. Consider a cell with number x written on it, if this cell is attacked by one of the bishops Gargari will get x dollars for it. Tell Gargari, how to place bishops on the chessboard to get maximum amount of money.

We assume a cell is attacked by a bishop, if the cell is located on the same diagonal with the bishop (the cell, where the bishop is, also considered attacked by it).


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2000). Each of the next n lines contains n integers a_{ij} (0 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ 10^9) — description of the chessboard.


-----Output-----

On the first line print the maximal number of dollars Gargari will get. On the next line print four integers: x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 ≤ x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ≤ n), where x_{i} is the number of the row where the i-th bishop should be placed, y_{i} is the number of the column where the i-th bishop should be placed. Consider rows are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and columns are numbered from 1 to n from left to right.

If there are several optimal solutions, you can print any of them.
