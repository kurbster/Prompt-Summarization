You have a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of only characters > and <. You may do some operations with this string, for each operation you have to choose some character that still remains in the string. If you choose a character >, the character that comes right after it is deleted (if the character you chose was the last one, nothing happens). If you choose a character <, the character that comes right before it is deleted (if the character you chose was the first one, nothing happens).

For example, if we choose character > in string > > < >, the string will become to > > >. And if we choose character < in string > <, the string will become to <.

The string is good if there is a sequence of operations such that after performing it only one character will remain in the string. For example, the strings >, > > are good. 

Before applying the operations, you may remove any number of characters from the given string (possibly none, possibly up to $n - 1$, but not the whole string). You need to calculate the minimum number of characters to be deleted from string $s$ so that it becomes good.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) – the number of test cases. Each test case is represented by two lines.

The first line of $i$-th test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) – the length of string $s$.

The second line of $i$-th test case contains string $s$, consisting of only characters > and <.


-----Output-----

For each test case print one line.

For $i$-th test case print the minimum number of characters to be deleted from string $s$ so that it becomes good.

Output

-----Note-----

In the first test case we can delete any character in string <>.

In the second test case we don't need to delete any characters. The string > < < is good, because we can perform the following sequence of operations: > < < $\rightarrow$ < < $\rightarrow$ <.
