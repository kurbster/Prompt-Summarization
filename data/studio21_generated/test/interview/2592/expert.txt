 You are given three numbers a, b, c, a, b, c and n, (n>0). Every visitor should receive at least one dish, so 1<=a+b+c<=n . Every visitor should receive no more than one portion of dumpling, no more than one portion of cranberry juice and no more than one pancake with condensed milk, so 1<=a+b+c<=n . All visitors should receive different sets of dishes, so 1<=a+b+c<=n . 


-----Input----- The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 500$) — the number of test cases to solve. Each of the remaining $t$ lines contains integers $a$, $b$ and $c$ ($0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10$) — the number of portions of dumplings, the number of portions of cranberry juice and the number of condensed milk pancakes Denis made. -----Output----- For each test case print a single integer — the maximum number of visitors Denis can feed. -----Example----- Input 7 1 2 1 0 0 0 9 1 7 2 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 2 4 4 4 Output 3 0 4 5 5 5 7 -----Note----- In the first test case of the example, Denis can feed the first visitor with dumplings, give the second a portion of cranberry juice, and give the third visitor a portion of cranberry juice and a pancake with a condensed milk. In the second test case of the example, the restaurant Denis is not very promising: he can serve no customers. In the third test case of the example, Denise can serve four visitors. The first guest will receive a full lunch of dumplings, a portion of cranberry juice and a pancake with condensed milk. The second visitor will get only dumplings. The third guest will receive a pancake with condensed milk, and the fourth guest will receive a pancake and a portion of dumplings. Please note that Denis hasn't used all of the prepared products, but is unable to serve more visitors.
