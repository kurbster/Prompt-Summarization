There are N points in a two-dimensional plane. The initial coordinates of the i-th point are (x_i, y_i). Now, each point starts moving at a speed of 1 per second, in a direction parallel to the x- or y- axis. You are given a character d_i that represents the specific direction in which the i-th point moves, as follows:
 - If d_i = R, the i-th point moves in the positive x direction;
 - If d_i = L, the i-th point moves in the negative x direction;
 - If d_i = U, the i-th point moves in the positive y direction;
 - If d_i = D, the i-th point moves in the negative y direction.
You can stop all the points at some moment of your choice after they start moving (including the moment they start moving).
Then, let x_{max} and x_{min} be the maximum and minimum among the x-coordinates of the N points, respectively. Similarly, let y_{max} and y_{min} be the maximum and minimum among the y-coordinates of the N points, respectively.
Find the minimum possible value of (x_{max} - x_{min}) \times (y_{max} - y_{min}) and print it.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - -10^8 \leq x_i,\ y_i \leq 10^8
 - x_i and y_i are integers.
 - d_i is R, L, U, or D.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
x_1 y_1 d_1
x_2 y_2 d_2
.
.
.
x_N y_N d_N

-----Output-----
Print the minimum possible value of (x_{max} - x_{min}) \times (y_{max} - y_{min}).
The output will be considered correct when its absolute or relative error from the judge's output is at most 10^{-9}.

-----Sample Input-----
2
0 3 D
3 0 L

-----Sample Output-----
0

After three seconds, the two points will meet at the origin. The value in question will be 0 at that moment.
