Ichihime is the current priestess of the Mahjong Soul Temple. She claims to be human, despite her cat ears.

These days the temple is holding a math contest. Usually, Ichihime lacks interest in these things, but this time the prize for the winner is her favorite — cookies. Ichihime decides to attend the contest. Now she is solving the following problem.[Image] 

You are given four positive integers $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, such that $a \leq b \leq c \leq d$. 

Your task is to find three integers $x$, $y$, $z$, satisfying the following conditions: $a \leq x \leq b$. $b \leq y \leq c$. $c \leq z \leq d$. There exists a triangle with a positive non-zero area and the lengths of its three sides are $x$, $y$, and $z$.

Ichihime desires to get the cookie, but the problem seems too hard for her. Can you help her?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 1000$)  — the number of test cases.

The next $t$ lines describe test cases. Each test case is given as four space-separated integers $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ ($1 \leq a \leq b \leq c \leq d \leq 10^9$).


-----Output-----

For each test case, print three integers $x$, $y$, $z$  — the integers you found satisfying the conditions given in the statement.

It is guaranteed that the answer always exists. If there are multiple answers, print any.


-----Example-----
Input
4
1 3 5 7
1 5 5 7
100000 200000 300000 400000
1 1 977539810 977539810

Output
3 4 5
5 5 5
182690 214748 300999
1 977539810 977539810
