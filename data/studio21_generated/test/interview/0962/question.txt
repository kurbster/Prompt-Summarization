Given is a directed graph G with N vertices and M edges.

The vertices are numbered 1 to N, and the i-th edge is directed from Vertex A_i to Vertex B_i.

It is guaranteed that the graph contains no self-loops or multiple edges.
Determine whether there exists an induced subgraph (see Notes) of G such that the in-degree and out-degree of every vertex are both 1. If the answer is yes, show one such subgraph.

Here the null graph is not considered as a subgraph.

-----Notes-----
For a directed graph G = (V, E), we call a directed graph G' = (V', E') satisfying the following conditions an induced subgraph of G:
 - V' is a (non-empty) subset of V.
 - E' is the set of all the edges in E that have both endpoints in V'.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 1000
 - 0 \leq M \leq 2000
 - 1 \leq A_i,B_i \leq N
 - A_i \neq B_i
 - All pairs (A_i, B_i) are distinct.
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
A_1 B_1
A_2 B_2
:
A_M B_M

-----Output-----
If there is no induced subgraph of G that satisfies the condition, print -1.
Otherwise, print an induced subgraph of G that satisfies the condition, in the following format:
K
v_1
v_2
:
v_K

This represents the induced subgraph of G with K vertices whose vertex set is \{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_K\}. (The order of v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_K does not matter.)
If there are multiple subgraphs of G that satisfy the condition, printing any of them is accepted.

-----Sample Input-----
4 5
1 2
2 3
2 4
4 1
4 3

-----Sample Output-----
3
1
2
4

The induced subgraph of G whose vertex set is \{1, 2, 4\} has the edge set \{(1, 2), (2, 4), (4, 1)\}. The in-degree and out-degree of every vertex in this graph are both 1.
