Given are a sequence A= {a_1,a_2,......a_N} of N positive even numbers, and an integer M.
Let a semi-common multiple of A be a positive integer X that satisfies the following condition for every k (1 \leq k \leq N):
 - There exists a non-negative integer p such that X= a_k \times (p+0.5).
Find the number of semi-common multiples of A among the integers between 1 and M (inclusive).

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq M \leq 10^9
 - 2 \leq a_i \leq 10^9
 - a_i is an even number.
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
a_1 a_2 ... a_N

-----Output-----
Print the number of semi-common multiples of A among the integers between 1 and M (inclusive).

-----Sample Input-----
2 50
6 10

-----Sample Output-----
2

 - 15 = 6  \times 2.5 
 - 15 = 10 \times 1.5 
 - 45 = 6  \times 7.5 
 - 45 = 10 \times 4.5 
Thus, 15 and 45 are semi-common multiples of A. There are no other semi-common multiples of A between 1 and 50, so the answer is 2.
