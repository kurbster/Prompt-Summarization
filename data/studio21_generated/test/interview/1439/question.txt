You are given a sequence of numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, and a number m.

Check if it is possible to choose a non-empty subsequence a_{i}_{j} such that the sum of numbers in this subsequence is divisible by m.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two numbers, n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^3) — the size of the original sequence and the number such that sum should be divisible by it.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the single line print either "YES" (without the quotes) if there exists the sought subsequence, or "NO" (without the quotes), if such subsequence doesn't exist.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 5
1 2 3

Output
YES

Input
1 6
5

Output
NO

Input
4 6
3 1 1 3

Output
YES

Input
6 6
5 5 5 5 5 5

Output
YES



-----Note-----

In the first sample test you can choose numbers 2 and 3, the sum of which is divisible by 5.

In the second sample test the single non-empty subsequence of numbers is a single number 5. Number 5 is not divisible by 6, that is, the sought subsequence doesn't exist.

In the third sample test you need to choose two numbers 3 on the ends.

In the fourth sample test you can take the whole subsequence.
