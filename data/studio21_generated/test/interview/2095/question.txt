Little Susie, thanks to her older brother, likes to play with cars. Today she decided to set up a tournament between them. The process of a tournament is described in the next paragraph.

There are n toy cars. Each pair collides. The result of a collision can be one of the following: no car turned over, one car turned over, both cars turned over. A car is good if it turned over in no collision. The results of the collisions are determined by an n × n matrix А: there is a number on the intersection of the і-th row and j-th column that describes the result of the collision of the і-th and the j-th car:    - 1: if this pair of cars never collided.  - 1 occurs only on the main diagonal of the matrix.  0: if no car turned over during the collision.  1: if only the i-th car turned over during the collision.  2: if only the j-th car turned over during the collision.  3: if both cars turned over during the collision. 

Susie wants to find all the good cars. She quickly determined which cars are good. Can you cope with the task?


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of cars.

Each of the next n lines contains n space-separated integers that determine matrix A. 

It is guaranteed that on the main diagonal there are  - 1, and  - 1 doesn't appear anywhere else in the matrix.

It is guaranteed that the input is correct, that is, if A_{ij} = 1, then A_{ji} = 2, if A_{ij} = 3, then A_{ji} = 3, and if A_{ij} = 0, then A_{ji} = 0.


-----Output-----

Print the number of good cars and in the next line print their space-separated indices in the increasing order.
