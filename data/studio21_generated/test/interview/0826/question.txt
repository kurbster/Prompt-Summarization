Snuke is visiting a shop in Tokyo called 109 to buy some logs.
He wants n logs: one of length 1, one of length 2, ..., and one of length n.
The shop has n+1 logs in stock: one of length 1, one of length 2, \dots, and one of length n+1. Each of these logs is sold for 1 yen (the currency of Japan).
He can cut these logs as many times as he wants after buying them. That is, he can get k logs of length L_1, \dots, L_k from a log of length L, where L = L_1 + \dots + L_k. He can also throw away unwanted logs.
Snuke wants to spend as little money as possible to get the logs he wants.
Find the minimum amount of money needed to get n logs of length 1 to n.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}

3

One way to get the logs he wants with 3 yen is:
 - Buy logs of length 2, 4, and 5.
 - Cut the log of length 5 into two logs of length 1 each and a log of length 3.
 - Throw away one of the logs of length 1.
