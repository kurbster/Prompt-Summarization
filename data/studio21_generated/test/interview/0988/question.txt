A classroom in a school has six rows with 3 desks in each row. Two people can use the same desk: one sitting on the left and one sitting on the right. 

Some places are already occupied, and some places are vacant. Petya has just entered the class and wants to occupy the most convenient place. The conveniences of the places are shown on the picture: [Image] 

Here, the desks in the top row are the closest to the blackboard, while the desks in the bottom row are the furthest from the blackboard.

You are given a plan of the class, where '*' denotes an occupied place, '.' denotes a vacant place, and the aisles are denoted by '-'. 

Find any of the most convenient vacant places for Petya.


-----Input-----

The input consists of 6 lines. Each line describes one row of desks, starting from the closest to the blackboard. Each line is given in the following format: two characters, each is '*' or '.' — the description of the left desk in the current row; a character '-' — the aisle; two characters, each is '*' or '.' — the description of the center desk in the current row; a character '-' — the aisle; two characters, each is '*' or '.' — the description of the right desk in the current row. So, the length of each of the six lines is 8.

It is guaranteed that there is at least one vacant place in the classroom.


-----Output-----
