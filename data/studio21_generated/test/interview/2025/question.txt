You are given several queries. In the i-th query you are given a single positive integer n_{i}. You are to represent n_{i} as a sum of maximum possible number of composite summands and print this maximum number, or print -1, if there are no such splittings.

An integer greater than 1 is composite, if it is not prime, i.e. if it has positive divisors not equal to 1 and the integer itself.


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5) — the number of queries.

q lines follow. The (i + 1)-th line contains single integer n_{i} (1 ≤ n_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the i-th query.


-----Output-----

For each query print the maximum possible number of summands in a valid splitting to composite summands, or -1, if there are no such splittings.


-----Examples-----
Input
1
12

Output
3

Input
2
6
8

Output
1
2

Input
3
1
2
3

Output
-1
-1
-1



-----Note-----

12 = 4 + 4 + 4 = 4 + 8 = 6 + 6 = 12, but the first splitting has the maximum possible number of summands.

8 = 4 + 4, 6 can't be split into several composite summands.

1, 2, 3 are less than any composite number, so they do not have valid splittings.
