Iahub has drawn a set of n points in the cartesian plane which he calls "special points". A quadrilateral is a simple polygon without self-intersections with four sides (also called edges) and four vertices (also called corners). Please note that a quadrilateral doesn't have to be convex. A special quadrilateral is one which has all four vertices in the set of special points. Given the set of special points, please calculate the maximal area of a special quadrilateral. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 300). Each of the next n lines contains two integers: x_{i}, y_{i} ( - 1000 ≤ x_{i}, y_{i} ≤ 1000) — the cartesian coordinates of ith special point. It is guaranteed that no three points are on the same line. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide. 


-----Output-----

Output a single real number — the maximal area of a special quadrilateral. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does't exceed 10^{ - 9}.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
0 0
0 4
4 0
4 4
2 3

Output
16.000000


-----Note-----

In the test example we can choose first 4 points to be the vertices of the quadrilateral. They form a square by side 4, so the area is 4·4 = 16.
