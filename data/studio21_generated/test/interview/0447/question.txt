Consider the decimal presentation of an integer. Let's call a number d-magic if digit d appears in decimal presentation of the number on even positions and nowhere else.

For example, the numbers 1727374, 17, 1 are 7-magic but 77, 7, 123, 34, 71 are not 7-magic. On the other hand the number 7 is 0-magic, 123 is 2-magic, 34 is 4-magic and 71 is 1-magic.

Find the number of d-magic numbers in the segment [a, b] that are multiple of m. Because the answer can be very huge you should only find its value modulo 10^9 + 7 (so you should find the remainder after dividing by 10^9 + 7).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers m, d (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000, 0 ≤ d ≤ 9) — the parameters from the problem statement.

The second line contains positive integer a in decimal presentation (without leading zeroes).

The third line contains positive integer b in decimal presentation (without leading zeroes).

It is guaranteed that a ≤ b, the number of digits in a and b are the same and don't exceed 2000.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer a — the remainder after dividing by 10^9 + 7 of the number of d-magic numbers in segment [a, b] that are multiple of m.
