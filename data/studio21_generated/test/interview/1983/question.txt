Ehab has an array $a$ of length $n$. He has just enough free time to make a new array consisting of $n$ copies of the old array, written back-to-back. What will be the length of the new array's longest increasing subsequence?

A sequence $a$ is a subsequence of an array $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. The longest increasing subsequence of an array is the longest subsequence such that its elements are ordered in strictly increasing order.


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer $t$ — the number of test cases you need to solve. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of elements in the array $a$.

The second line contains $n$ space-separated integers $a_1$, $a_2$, $\ldots$, $a_{n}$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$) — the elements of the array $a$.

The sum of $n$ across the test cases doesn't exceed $10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each testcase, output the length of the longest increasing subsequence of $a$ if you concatenate it to itself $n$ times.


-----Example-----
Input
2
3
3 2 1
6
3 1 4 1 5 9

Output
3
5



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the new array is $[3,2,\textbf{1},3,\textbf{2},1,\textbf{3},2,1]$. The longest increasing subsequence is marked in bold.

In the second sample, the longest increasing subsequence will be $[1,3,4,5,9]$.
