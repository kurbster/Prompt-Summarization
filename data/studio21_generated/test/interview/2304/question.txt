There are N people standing on the x-axis.
Let the coordinate of Person i be x_i.
For every i, x_i is an integer between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive).
It is possible that more than one person is standing at the same coordinate.
You will given M pieces of information regarding the positions of these people.
The i-th piece of information has the form (L_i, R_i, D_i).
This means that Person R_i is to the right of Person L_i by D_i units of distance, that is, x_{R_i} - x_{L_i} = D_i holds.
It turns out that some of these M pieces of information may be incorrect.
Determine if there exists a set of values (x_1, x_2, ..., x_N) that is consistent with the given pieces of information.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 100 000
 - 0 \leq M \leq 200 000
 - 1 \leq L_i, R_i \leq N (1 \leq i \leq M)
 - 0 \leq D_i \leq 10 000 (1 \leq i \leq M)
 - L_i \neq R_i (1 \leq i \leq M)
 - If i \neq j, then (L_i, R_i) \neq (L_j, R_j) and (L_i, R_i) \neq (R_j, L_j).
 - D_i are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
L_1 R_1 D_1
L_2 R_2 D_2
:
L_M R_M D_M

-----Output-----
If there exists a set of values (x_1, x_2, ..., x_N) that is consistent with all given pieces of information, print Yes; if it does not exist, print No.

-----Sample Input-----
3 3
1 2 1
2 3 1
1 3 2

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

Some possible sets of values (x_1, x_2, x_3) are (0, 1, 2) and (101, 102, 103).
