There are n piles of pebbles on the table, the i-th pile contains a_{i} pebbles. Your task is to paint each pebble using one of the k given colors so that for each color c and any two piles i and j the difference between the number of pebbles of color c in pile i and number of pebbles of color c in pile j is at most one.

In other words, let's say that b_{i}, c is the number of pebbles of color c in the i-th pile. Then for any 1 ≤ c ≤ k, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n the following condition must be satisfied |b_{i}, c - b_{j}, c| ≤ 1. It isn't necessary to use all k colors: if color c hasn't been used in pile i, then b_{i}, c is considered to be zero.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100), separated by a space — the number of piles and the number of colors respectively.

The second line contains n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) denoting number of pebbles in each of the piles.


-----Output-----

If there is no way to paint the pebbles satisfying the given condition, output "NO" (without quotes) .

Otherwise in the first line output "YES" (without quotes). Then n lines should follow, the i-th of them should contain a_{i} space-separated integers. j-th (1 ≤ j ≤ a_{i}) of these integers should be equal to the color of the j-th pebble in the i-th pile. If there are several possible answers, you may output any of them.
