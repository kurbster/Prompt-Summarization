 You are given an integer $a$ and an integer $x$. You need to output the number of non-negative solutions of the equation $a - (a \oplus x) - x = 0$. 
-----Input----- Each test contains several possible values of $a$ and your task is to find the number of equation's solution for each of them. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of these values. The following $t$ lines contain the values of parameter $a$, each value is an integer from $0$ to $2^{30} - 1$ inclusive. -----Output----- For each value of $a$ print exactly one integer — the number of non-negative solutions of the equation for the given value of the parameter. Print answers in the same order as values of $a$ appear in the input. One can show that the number of solutions is always finite. -----Example----- Input 3 0 2 1073741823 Output 1 2 1073741824 -----Note----- Let's define the bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operation. Given two integers $x$ and $y$, consider their binary representations (possibly with leading zeroes): $x_k \dots x_2 x_1 x_0$ and $y_k \dots y_2 y_1 y_0$. Here, $x_i$ is the $i$-th bit of the number $x$ and $y_i$ is the $i$-th bit of the number $y$. Let $r = x \oplus y$ be the result of the XOR operation of $x$ and $y$. Then $r$ is defined as $r_k \dots r_2 r_1 r_0$ where: $$ r_i = \left\{ \begin{aligned} 1, ~ \text{if} ~ x_i \ne y_i \\ 0, ~ \text{if} ~ x_i = y_i \end{aligned} \right. $$ For the first value of the parameter, only $x = 0$ is a solution of the equation. For the second value of the parameter, solutions are $x = 0$ and $x = 2$.
