There are N islands and M bridges.
The i-th bridge connects the A_i-th and B_i-th islands bidirectionally.
Initially, we can travel between any two islands using some of these bridges.
However, the results of a survey show that these bridges will all collapse because of aging, in the order from the first bridge to the M-th bridge.
Let the inconvenience be the number of pairs of islands (a, b) (a < b) such that we are no longer able to travel between the a-th and b-th islands using some of the bridges remaining.
For each i (1 \leq i \leq M), find the inconvenience just after the i-th bridge collapses.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq M \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq A_i < B_i \leq N
 - All pairs (A_i, B_i) are distinct.
 - The inconvenience is initially 0.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
A_1 B_1
A_2 B_2
\vdots
A_M B_M

-----Output-----
In the order i = 1, 2, ..., M, print the inconvenience just after the i-th bridge collapses.
Note that the answer may not fit into a 32-bit integer type.

-----Sample Input-----
4 5
1 2
3 4
1 3
2 3
1 4

-----Sample Output-----
0
0
4
5
6

For example, when the first to third bridges have collapsed, the inconvenience is 4 since we can no longer travel between the pairs (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4) and (3, 4).
