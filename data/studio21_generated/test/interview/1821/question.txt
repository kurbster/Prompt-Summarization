Alice is a beginner composer and now she is ready to create another masterpiece. And not even the single one but two at the same time! 

Alice has a sheet with n notes written on it. She wants to take two such non-empty non-intersecting subsequences that both of them form a melody and sum of their lengths is maximal.

Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Subsequence forms a melody when each two adjacent notes either differs by 1 or are congruent modulo 7.

You should write a program which will calculate maximum sum of lengths of such two non-empty non-intersecting subsequences that both of them form a melody.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 5000).

The second line contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^5) — notes written on a sheet.


-----Output-----

Print maximum sum of lengths of such two non-empty non-intersecting subsequences that both of them form a melody.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
1 2 4 5

Output
4

Input
6
62 22 60 61 48 49

Output
5



-----Note-----

In the first example subsequences [1, 2] and [4, 5] give length 4 in total.

In the second example subsequences [62, 48, 49] and [60, 61] give length 5 in total. If you choose subsequence [62, 61] in the first place then the second melody will have maximum length 2, that gives the result of 4, which is not maximal.
