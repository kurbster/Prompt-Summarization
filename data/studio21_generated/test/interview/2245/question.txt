Alice and Bob play a game. There is a paper strip which is divided into n + 1 cells numbered from left to right starting from 0. There is a chip placed in the n-th cell (the last one).

Players take turns, Alice is first. Each player during his or her turn has to move the chip 1, 2 or k cells to the left (so, if the chip is currently in the cell i, the player can move it into cell i - 1, i - 2 or i - k). The chip should not leave the borders of the paper strip: it is impossible, for example, to move it k cells to the left if the current cell has number i < k. The player who can't make a move loses the game.

Who wins if both participants play optimally?

Alice and Bob would like to play several games, so you should determine the winner in each game.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) — the number of games. Next T lines contain one game per line. All games are independent.

Each of the next T lines contains two integers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 3 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) — the length of the strip and the constant denoting the third move, respectively.


-----Output-----

For each game, print Alice if Alice wins this game and Bob otherwise.
