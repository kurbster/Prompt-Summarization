The little girl loves the problems on array queries very much.

One day she came across a rather well-known problem: you've got an array of n elements (the elements of the array are indexed starting from 1); also, there are q queries, each one is defined by a pair of integers l_{i}, r_{i} (1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ r_{i} ≤ n). You need to find for each query the sum of elements of the array with indexes from l_{i} to r_{i}, inclusive.

The little girl found the problem rather boring. She decided to reorder the array elements before replying to the queries in a way that makes the sum of query replies maximum possible. Your task is to find the value of this maximum sum.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of elements in the array and the number of queries, correspondingly.

The next line contains n space-separated integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 2·10^5) — the array elements.

Each of the following q lines contains two space-separated integers l_{i} and r_{i} (1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ r_{i} ≤ n) — the i-th query.


-----Output-----

In a single line print a single integer — the maximum sum of query replies after the array elements are reordered.

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.
