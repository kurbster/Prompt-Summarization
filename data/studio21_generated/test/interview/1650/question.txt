You are given a positive integer L in base two.
How many pairs of non-negative integers (a, b) satisfy the following conditions?
 - a + b \leq L
 - a + b = a \mbox{ XOR } b
Since there can be extremely many such pairs, print the count modulo 10^9 + 7.
 What is XOR?
The XOR of integers A and B, A \mbox{ XOR } B, is defined as follows:
 - When A \mbox{ XOR } B is written in base two, the digit in the 2^k's place (k \geq 0) is 1 if either A or B, but not both, has 1 in the 2^k's place, and 0 otherwise.
For example, 3 \mbox{ XOR } 5 = 6. (In base two: 011 \mbox{ XOR } 101 = 110.)

-----Constraints-----
 - L is given in base two, without leading zeros.
 - 1 \leq L < 2^{100\ 001}

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
L

-----Output-----
Print the number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions, modulo 10^9 + 7.

-----Sample Input-----
10

-----Sample Output-----
5

Five pairs (a, b) satisfy the conditions: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, 2) and (2, 0).
