A student of z-school found a kind of sorting called z-sort. The array a with n elements are z-sorted if two conditions hold:

  a_{i} ≥ a_{i} - 1 for all even i,  a_{i} ≤ a_{i} - 1 for all odd i > 1. 

For example the arrays [1,2,1,2] and [1,1,1,1] are z-sorted while the array [1,2,3,4] isn’t z-sorted.

Can you make the array z-sorted?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of elements in the array a.

The second line contains n integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array a.


-----Output-----

If it's possible to make the array a z-sorted print n space separated integers a_{i} — the elements after z-sort. Otherwise print the only word "Impossible".
