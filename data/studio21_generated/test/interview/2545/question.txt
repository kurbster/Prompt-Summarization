You are given two integers $a$ and $b$. You may perform any number of operations on them (possibly zero).

During each operation you should choose any positive integer $x$ and set $a := a - x$, $b := b - 2x$ or $a := a - 2x$, $b := b - x$. Note that you may choose different values of $x$ in different operations.

Is it possible to make $a$ and $b$ equal to $0$ simultaneously?

Your program should answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases.

Then the test cases follow, each test case is represented by one line containing two integers $a$ and $b$ for this test case ($0 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

For each test case print the answer to it — YES if it is possible to make $a$ and $b$ equal to $0$ simultaneously, and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----
Input
3
6 9
1 1
1 2

Output
YES
NO
YES



-----Note-----

In the first test case of the example two operations can be used to make both $a$ and $b$ equal to zero:  choose $x = 4$ and set $a := a - x$, $b := b - 2x$. Then $a = 6 - 4 = 2$, $b = 9 - 8 = 1$;  choose $x = 1$ and set $a := a - 2x$, $b := b - x$. Then $a = 2 - 2 = 0$, $b = 1 - 1 = 0$.
