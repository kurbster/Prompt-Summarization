In this problem at each moment you have a set of intervals. You can move from interval (a, b) from our set to interval (c, d) from our set if and only if c < a < d or c < b < d. Also there is a path from interval I_1 from our set to interval I_2 from our set if there is a sequence of successive moves starting from I_1 so that we can reach I_2.

Your program should handle the queries of the following two types:  "1 x y" (x < y) — add the new interval (x, y) to the set of intervals. The length of the new interval is guaranteed to be strictly greater than all the previous intervals. "2 a b" (a ≠ b) — answer the question: is there a path from a-th (one-based) added interval to b-th (one-based) added interval? 

Answer all the queries. Note, that initially you have an empty set of intervals.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains integer n denoting the number of queries, (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each of the following lines contains a query as described above. All numbers in the input are integers and don't exceed 10^9 by their absolute value.

It's guaranteed that all queries are correct.


-----Output-----

For each query of the second type print "YES" or "NO" on a separate line depending on the answer.
