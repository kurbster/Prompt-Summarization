Dima got into number sequences. Now he's got sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, consisting of n positive integers. Also, Dima has got a function f(x), which can be defined with the following recurrence:  f(0) = 0;  f(2·x) = f(x);  f(2·x + 1) = f(x) + 1. 

Dima wonders, how many pairs of indexes (i, j) (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n) are there, such that f(a_{i}) = f(a_{j}). Help him, count the number of such pairs. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The second line contains n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9).

The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.


-----Output-----

In a single line print the answer to the problem.

Please, don't use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 2 4

Output
3

Input
3
5 3 1

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first sample any pair (i, j) will do, so the answer is 3.

In the second sample only pair (1, 2) will do.
