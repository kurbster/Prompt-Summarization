You are given array consisting of n integers. Your task is to find the maximum length of an increasing subarray of the given array.

A subarray is the sequence of consecutive elements of the array. Subarray is called increasing if each element of this subarray strictly greater than previous.


-----Input-----

The first line contains single positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of integers.

The second line contains n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print the maximum length of an increasing subarray of the given array.
