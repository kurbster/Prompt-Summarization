 You are given an array b. You need to find maximum number of elements array b could contain originally. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer p (1 ≤ p < 10^100000). It is guaranteed that number p doesn't contain any leading zeroes. -----Output----- Print an integer — the maximum number of elements array b could contain originally. -----Examples----- Input 9555 Output 4 Input 10000000005 Output 2 Input 800101 Output 3 Input 45 Output 1 Input 1000000000000001223300003342220044555 Output 17 Input 19992000 Output 1 Input 310200 Output 2 -----Note----- Let's consider the test examples:   Originally array b can be equal to {5, 9, 5, 5}. The sequence of George's changes could have been: {5, 9, 5, 5} → {5, 5, 95} → {95, 55} → {9555}.  Originally array b could be equal to {1000000000, 5}. Please note that the array b cannot contain zeros.  Originally array b could be equal to {800, 10, 1}.  Originally array b could be equal to {45}. It cannot be equal to {4, 5}, because George can get only array {54} from this array in one operation.  Note that the numbers can be very large.
