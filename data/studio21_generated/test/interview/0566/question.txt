You have r red, g green and b blue balloons. To decorate a single table for the banquet you need exactly three balloons. Three balloons attached to some table shouldn't have the same color. What maximum number t of tables can be decorated if we know number of balloons of each color?

Your task is to write a program that for given values r, g and b will find the maximum number t of tables, that can be decorated in the required manner.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers r, g and b (0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·10^9) — the number of red, green and blue baloons respectively. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer t — the maximum number of tables that can be decorated in the required manner.


-----Examples-----

1

Input
2 3 3

-----Note-----

In the first sample you can decorate the tables with the following balloon sets: "rgg", "gbb", "brr", "rrg", where "r", "g" and "b" represent the red, green and blue balls, respectively.
