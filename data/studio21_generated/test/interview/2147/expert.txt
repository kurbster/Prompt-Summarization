 You are given a set of 4n rules. You need to determine the order in which you want to apply all the 4n rules so that at any given time the memory of each of the servers contained at most 9 processes (old and new together), or tell that it is impossible. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30 000) — the number of servers of the social network. Next 4n lines contain the rules of replicating processes, the i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ 4n) of these lines as form a_{i}, b_{i}, c_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i}, c_{i} ≤ n) and describes rule a_{i} → (b_{i}, c_{i}). It is guaranteed that each number of a server from 1 to n occurs four times in the set of all a_{i}, and eight times among a set that unites all b_{i} and c_{i}. -----Output----- If the required order of performing rules does not exist, print "NO" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print in the first line "YES" (without the quotes), and in the second line — a sequence of 4n numbers from 1 to 4n, giving the numbers of the rules in the order they are applied. The sequence should be a permutation, that is, include each number from 1 to 4n exactly once. If there are multiple possible variants, you are allowed to print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 Output YES 1 2 5 6 3 7 4 8 Input 3 1 2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 1 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 Output YES 2 3 4 6 7 8 10 11 12 1 5 9 -----Note----- ^{(1)} To be extremely accurate, we should note that the amount of server memory is 1 GiB = 1024 MiB and processes require 100 MiB RAM where a gibibyte (GiB) is the amount of RAM of 2^30 bytes and a mebibyte (MiB) is the amount of RAM of 2^20 bytes. In the first sample test the network uses two servers, each of which initially has four launched processes. In accordance with the rules of replication, each of the processes must be destroyed and twice run on another server. One of the possible answers is given in the statement: after applying rules 1 and 2 the first server will have 2 old running processes, and the second server will have 8 (4 old and 4 new) processes. After we apply rules 5 and 6, both servers will have 6 running processes (2 old and 4 new). After we apply rules 3 and 7, both servers will have 7 running processes (1 old and 6 new), and after we apply rules 4 and 8, each server will have 8 running processes. At no time the number of processes on a single server exceeds 9. In the second sample test the network uses three servers. On each server, three processes are replicated into two processes on the same server, and the fourth one is replicated in one process for each of the two remaining servers. As a result of applying rules 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12 each server would have 7 processes (6 old and 1 new), as a result of applying rules 1, 5, 9 each server will have 8 processes. At no time the number of processes on a single server exceeds 9.
