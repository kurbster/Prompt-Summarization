You are given two strings $s$, and $t$. Count the number of substrings of $s$ that contain $t$ as a subsequence at least once.

Note that a $substring$ and a $subsequence$ both consist of characters from the original string, in order. In a $substring$, the characters must be contiguous in the original string, but in a $subsequence$, they are not required to be contiguous. In the string abcde, ace is a subsequence but not a substring.

If $s$ is aa and $t$ is a, then the answer is $3$: [a]a, [aa], and a[a].

-----Input-----
Each test case will consist of exactly two lines.

The first line will contain string $s$ ($1\! \le \! |s|\! \le \! 10^5, s\! \in \! [a{-}z]^*$), with no other characters.

The second line will contain string $t$ ($1\! \le \! |t|\! \le \! 100, |t|\! \le \! |s|, t\! \in \! [a{-}z]^*$), with no other characters.

-----Output-----
Output a single integer, which is the number of substrings of $s$ that contain $t$ as a subsequence at least once.

-----Examples-----

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
a
Sample Output 1:
26

Sample Input 2:
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
m
Sample Output 2:
