Given four integers a, b, c, d. Find number of solutions x < y, where a ≤ x ≤ b and c ≤ y ≤ d and x, y integers.

-----Input-----
The first line contains an integer T denoting number of tests.
First line of each test case contains four positive integer numbers a, b, c and d.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single number each in separate line denoting number of integer solutions as asked in the problem.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 20 
- 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ 106 

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask #1: (30 points)  1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ 103.
- Subtask #2: (70 points)  Original constraints.

-----Example-----
