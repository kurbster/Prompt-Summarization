A haiku is a three-line poem in which the first and third lines contain $5$ syllables each, and the second line contains $7$ syllables. 

An example of a haiku is: Blue Ridge mountain road.

 Leaves, glowing in autumn sun,

 fall in Virginia. 

Write a program to examine a line of English text and and attempt to render it as a haiku. This will require counting the syllables in the words of the text, which should be done according to the following rules:
 - A word consists of a non-empty, maximal string of zero or more alphabetic characters (upper and/or lower-case) followed by zero or more non-blank, non-alphabetic characters.
 - Upper/lower case distinctions are ignored for the purpose of counting syllables, but must be retained in the final output.
 - Non-alphabetic characters are ignored for the purpose of counting syllables, but must be retained in the final output.
 - The characters ‘A’, ‘E’, ‘I’, ‘O’, ‘U’, and ‘Y’ are vowels. All other alphabetic characters are consonants.

Exceptions to this rule:
 - The character sequence “QU” is considered to be a single consonant.
 - The letter ‘Y’ is considered to be a consonant if it is immediately followed by one of the other vowels.
 - Every word has at least one syllable.

For example, “Fly”,“I”, “!?”, and “Ssshhh!” are words of one syllable.
 - Each (maximal) string of one or more consonants with at least one vowel to either side indicates a division into separate syllables.

For example, “strong” has one syllable, “stronger” has $2$, and “bookkeeper” has $3$. “player” has two syllables (because the ‘y’, being followed by an ‘e’, is considered a consonant).

Exceptions to this rule are:
 - An ‘E’ appearing as the last alphabetic character in a word is silent and should be ignored unless the next-to-last alphabetic character is an ‘L’ and the character immediately before that is another consonant.

For example, “cake”, “ale” and “pale” have one syllable. “able” has two.
 - An ‘ES’ sequence at the end of the alphabetic sequence in a word does not add a syllable unless immediately preceded by two or more consonants.

For example, “ales” and “pales” have one syllable. “witches” and “verses” have two.

-----Input-----
Input will consist of a single line of text consisting of a sequence of one or more words (as defined above) separated by single blanks.

The total line length will not exceed $200$ characters.

-----Output-----
If the words in the input line can be divided into a haiku, then print the haiku as three lines of output.
 - Each line should be left-justified.
 - A single space should separate each pair of words within a line.
 - Upper/lower casing from the input should be preserved.
 - Non-alphabetic characters terminating each word should be preserved.
 - A word cannot be split across multiple lines.

If the words in the input cannot be divided into a haiku, print the line of input with no changes.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
Blue Ridge mountain road. Leaves, glowing in autumn sun, fall in Virginia.
Sample Output 1:
Blue Ridge mountain road.
Leaves, glowing in autumn sun,
fall in Virginia.
