Given are an integer N and four characters c_{\mathrm{AA}}, c_{\mathrm{AB}}, c_{\mathrm{BA}}, and c_{\mathrm{BB}}.
Here, it is guaranteed that each of those four characters is A or B.
Snuke has a string s, which is initially AB.
Let |s| denote the length of s.
Snuke can do the four kinds of operations below zero or more times in any order:
 - Choose i such that 1 \leq i < |s|, s_{i} = A, s_{i+1} = A and insert c_{\mathrm{AA}} between the i-th and (i+1)-th characters of s.
 - Choose i such that 1 \leq i < |s|, s_{i} = A, s_{i+1} = B and insert c_{\mathrm{AB}} between the i-th and (i+1)-th characters of s.
 - Choose i such that 1 \leq i < |s|, s_{i} = B, s_{i+1} = A and insert c_{\mathrm{BA}} between the i-th and (i+1)-th characters of s.
 - Choose i such that 1 \leq i < |s|, s_{i} = B, s_{i+1} = B and insert c_{\mathrm{BB}} between the i-th and (i+1)-th characters of s.
Find the number, modulo (10^9+7), of strings that can be s when Snuke has done the operations so that the length of s becomes N.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 1000
 - Each of c_{\mathrm{AA}}, c_{\mathrm{AB}}, c_{\mathrm{BA}}, and c_{\mathrm{BB}} is A or B.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
c_{\mathrm{AA}}
c_{\mathrm{AB}}
c_{\mathrm{BA}}
c_{\mathrm{BB}}

-----Output-----
Print the number, modulo (10^9+7), of strings that can be s when Snuke has done the operations so that the length of s becomes N.

-----Sample Input-----
4
A
B
B
A

-----Sample Output-----
2

 - There are two strings that can be s when Snuke is done: ABAB and ABBB.
