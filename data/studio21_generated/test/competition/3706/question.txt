On the way to school, Karen became fixated on the puzzle game on her phone! [Image] 

The game is played as follows. In each level, you have a grid with n rows and m columns. Each cell originally contains the number 0.

One move consists of choosing one row or column, and adding 1 to all of the cells in that row or column.

To win the level, after all the moves, the number in the cell at the i-th row and j-th column should be equal to g_{i}, j.

Karen is stuck on one level, and wants to know a way to beat this level using the minimum number of moves. Please, help her with this task!


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains two integers, n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100), the number of rows and the number of columns in the grid, respectively.

The next n lines each contain m integers. In particular, the j-th integer in the i-th of these rows contains g_{i}, j (0 ≤ g_{i}, j ≤ 500).


-----Output-----

If there is an error and it is actually not possible to beat the level, output a single integer -1.

Otherwise, on the first line, output a single integer k, the minimum number of moves necessary to beat the level.

The next k lines should each contain one of the following, describing the moves in the order they must be done:  row x, (1 ≤ x ≤ n) describing a move of the form "choose the x-th row".  col x, (1 ≤ x ≤ m) describing a move of the form "choose the x-th column". 

If there are multiple optimal solutions, output any one of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 5
2 2 2 3 2
0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 2 1

Output
4
row 1
row 1
col 4
row 3

Input
3 3
0 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 0

Output
-1

Input
3 3
1 1 1
1 1 1
1 1 1

Output
3
row 1
row 2
row 3



-----Note-----

In the first test case, Karen has a grid with 3 rows and 5 columns. She can perform the following 4 moves to beat the level: [Image] 

In the second test case, Karen has a grid with 3 rows and 3 columns. It is clear that it is impossible to beat the level; performing any move will create three 1s on the grid, but it is required to only have one 1 in the center.

In the third test case, Karen has a grid with 3 rows and 3 columns. She can perform the following 3 moves to beat the level: [Image] 

Note that this is not the only solution; another solution, among others, is col 1, col 2, col 3.
