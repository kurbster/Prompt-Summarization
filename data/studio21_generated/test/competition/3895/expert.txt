 You have two functions g: [n]   [m], h: [m]   [n]. You need to find a positive integer m such that g(h(x)) = x for all $x \in [ m ]$, and h(g(x)) = f(x) for all $x \in [ n ]$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The second line contains n space-separated integers — values f(1), ..., f(n) (1 ≤ f(i) ≤ n). -----Output----- If there is no answer, print one integer -1. Otherwise, on the first line print the number m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^6). On the second line print n numbers g(1), ..., g(n). On the third line print m numbers h(1), ..., h(m). If there are several correct answers, you may output any of them. It is guaranteed that if a valid answer exists, then there is an answer satisfying the above restrictions. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 2 3 Output 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 Input 3 2 2 2 Output 1 1 1 1 2 Input 2 2 1 Output -1
