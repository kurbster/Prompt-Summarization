Slavko decided to challenge Mirko! He gave him a real number $P$ and a bag full of pieces of paper with exactly one number between $1$ and $5$ inclusive written on each paper. There is an unlimited quantity of each type of paper.

Mirko’s task is to pick the minimum number of papers in a way that the average of the numbers written on them equals exactly $P$.

-----Input-----
First and only line of input contains real number $P$. $P$ will have between 1 and 9 decimal places, inclusive $(1 \leq P \leq 5)$.

-----Output-----
First and only line of output should contain five nonnegative integers – numbers of ones, twos, threes, fours and fives used, respectively. If there are multiple solutions, output any one of them.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
5.0
Sample Output 1:
0 0 0 0 1

Sample Input 2:
4.5
Sample Output 2:
0 0 0 1 1
