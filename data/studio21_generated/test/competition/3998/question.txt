A group of n friends enjoys playing popular video game Toda 2. There is a rating system describing skill level of each player, initially the rating of the i-th friend is r_{i}.

The friends decided to take part in the championship as a team. But they should have equal ratings to be allowed to compose a single team consisting of all n friends. So the friends are faced with the problem: how to make all their ratings equal.

One way to change ratings is to willingly lose in some matches. Friends can form a party consisting of two to five (but not more than n) friends and play a match in the game. When the party loses, the rating of each of its members decreases by 1. A rating can't become negative, so r_{i} = 0 doesn't change after losing.

The friends can take part in multiple matches, each time making a party from any subset of friends (but remember about constraints on party size: from 2 to 5 members).

The friends want to make their ratings equal but as high as possible.

Help the friends develop a strategy of losing the matches so that all their ratings become equal and the resulting rating is maximum possible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of friends.

The second line contains n non-negative integers r_1, r_2, ..., r_{n} (0 ≤ r_{i} ≤ 100), where r_{i} is the initial rating of the i-th friend.


-----Output-----

In the first line, print a single integer R — the final rating of each of the friends.

In the second line, print integer t — the number of matches the friends have to play. Each of the following t lines should contain n characters '0' or '1', where the j-th character of the i-th line is equal to:

  '0', if friend j should not play in match i,  '1', if friend j should play in match i. 

Each line should contain between two and five characters '1', inclusive.

The value t should not exceed 10^4, it is guaranteed that such solution exists. 

Remember that you shouldn't minimize the value t, but you should maximize R. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.
