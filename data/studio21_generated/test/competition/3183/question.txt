-----Input-----
The first line of input contains a line contains a line with four non-negative integers, $2 \le n \le 250$, $0 \le m \le 5000$, $0 \le s \le n-1$ and $0 \le t \le n-1$, separated by single spaces, where $n$ is the numbers of nodes in the graph, $m$ is the number of edges, $s$ is the source and $t$ is the sink ($s \ne t$). Nodes are numbered from $0$ to $n-1$. Then follow $m$ lines, each line consisting of four (space-separated) integers $u$, $v$, $c$ and $w$ indicating that there is an edge from $u$ to $v$ in the graph with capacity $1 \le c \le 10000$ and cost $1 \le w \le 1000$.

-----Output-----
Output a single line containing two integers; the size $F$ of a maximum flow from node $s$ to node $t$, and the cost of a mimimum cost flow of size $F$. You may assume that $F < 2^{31}$.
