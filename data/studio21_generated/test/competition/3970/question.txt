A k-multiple free set is a set of integers where there is no pair of integers where one is equal to another integer multiplied by k. That is, there are no two integers x and y (x < y) from the set, such that y = x·k.

You're given a set of n distinct positive integers. Your task is to find the size of it's largest k-multiple free subset.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). The next line contains a list of n distinct positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9).

All the numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.


-----Output-----

On the only line of the output print the size of the largest k-multiple free subset of {a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}}.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 2
2 3 6 5 4 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the sample input one of the possible maximum 2-multiple free subsets is {4, 5, 6}.
