Primonimo is a game played on an $n \times m$ board filled with numbers taken from the range $1 \ldots p$ for some prime number $p$. At each move, a player selects a square and adds $1$ to the numbers in all squares in the same row and column as the selected square. If a square already shows the number $p$, it wraps around to $1$.

The game is won if all squares show $p$. Given an initial board, find a sequence of moves that wins the game!

-----Input-----
The input consists of a single test case. The first line contains three numbers $n \ m \ p$ denoting the number of rows $n$ ($1 \le n \le 20$), the number of columns $m$ ($1 \le m \le 20$), and a prime number $p$ ($2 \le p \le 97$). Each of the next $n$ lines consists of $m$ numbers in the range $1 \ldots p$.

-----Output-----
If a winning sequence of at most $p \cdot m \cdot n$ moves exists, output an integer $k \le p \cdot m \cdot n$ denoting the number of moves in the sequence. Then output $k$ moves as a sequence of integers that numbers the board in row-major order, starting with $1$. If there are multiple such sequences, you may output any one of them. If no winning sequence exists, output -1.
