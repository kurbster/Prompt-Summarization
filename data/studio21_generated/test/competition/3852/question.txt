Snuke has an integer sequence, a, of length N. The i-th element of a (1-indexed) is a_{i}.
He can perform the following operation any number of times:
 - Operation: Choose integers x and y between 1 and N (inclusive), and add a_x to a_y.
He would like to perform this operation between 0 and 2N times (inclusive) so that a satisfies the condition below. Show one such sequence of operations.
It can be proved that such a sequence of operations always exists under the constraints in this problem.
 - Condition: a_1 \leq a_2 \leq ...  \leq a_{N}

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 50
 - -10^{6} \leq a_i \leq 10^{6}
 - All input values are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
a_1 a_2 ... a_{N}

-----Output-----
Let m be the number of operations in your solution. In the first line, print m.
In the i-th of the subsequent m lines, print the numbers x and y chosen in the i-th operation, with a space in between.
The output will be considered correct if m is between 0 and 2N (inclusive) and a satisfies the condition after the m operations.

-----Sample Input-----
3
-2 5 -1

-----Sample Output-----
2
2 3
3 3

 - After the first operation, a = (-2,5,4).
 - After the second operation, a = (-2,5,8), and the condition is now satisfied.
