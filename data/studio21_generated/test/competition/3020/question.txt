“Drat!” cursed Charles. “This stupid carry bar is not working in my Engine! I just tried to calculate the square of a number, but it’s wrong; all of the carries are lost.”

“Hmm,” mused Ada, “arithmetic without carries! I wonder if I can figure out what your original input was, based on the result I see on the Engine.”

Carryless addition, denoted by $\oplus $, is the same as normal addition, except any carries are ignored (in base $10$). Thus, $37 \oplus 48$ is $75$, not $85$.

Carryless multiplication, denoted by $\otimes $, is performed using the schoolboy algorithm for multiplication, column by column, but the intermediate additions are calculated using carryless addition. More formally, Let $a_ m a_{m-1} \ldots a_1 a_0$ be the digits of $a$, where $a_0$ is its least significant digit. Similarly define $b_ n b_{n-1} \ldots b_1 b_0$ be the digits of $b$. The digits of $c = a \otimes b$ are given by the following equation:\[ c_ k = \left( a_0 b_ k \oplus a_1 b_{k-1} \oplus \cdots \oplus a_{k-1} b_1 \oplus a_ k b_0 \right) \bmod {10}, \]

where any $a_ i$ or $b_ j$ is considered zero if $i > m$ or $j > n$. For example, $9 \otimes 1234$ is $9876$, $90 \otimes 1234$ is $98760$, and $99 \otimes 1234$ is $97536$.

Given $N$, find the smallest positive integer $a$ such that $a \otimes a = N$.

-----Input-----
The input consists of a single line with a positive integer $N$, with at most $25$ digits and no leading zeros.

-----Output-----
Print, on a single line, the least positive number $a$ such that $a \otimes a = N$. If there is no such $a$, print ‘-1’ instead.
