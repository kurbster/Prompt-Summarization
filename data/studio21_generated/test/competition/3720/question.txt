Vasya and Petya wrote down all integers from 1 to n to play the "powers" game (n can be quite large; however, Vasya and Petya are not confused by this fact).

Players choose numbers in turn (Vasya chooses first). If some number x is chosen at the current turn, it is forbidden to choose x or all of its other positive integer powers (that is, x^2, x^3, ...) at the next turns. For instance, if the number 9 is chosen at the first turn, one cannot choose 9 or 81 later, while it is still allowed to choose 3 or 27. The one who cannot make a move loses.

Who wins if both Vasya and Petya play optimally?


-----Input-----

Input contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print the name of the winner — "Vasya" or "Petya" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
Vasya

Input
2

Output
Petya

Input
8

Output
Petya



-----Note-----

In the first sample Vasya will choose 1 and win immediately.

In the second sample no matter which number Vasya chooses during his first turn, Petya can choose the remaining number and win.
