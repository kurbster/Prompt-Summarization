Per is obsessed with factorials. He likes to calculate them, estimate them, read about them, draw them, dream about them and fight about them. He even has the value of $12!=479001600$ tattooed on his back.

He noticed a long time ago that factorials have many trailing zeroes and also wrote a program to calculate the number of trailing zeroes. For example $12!$ ends with 600, so it has 2 trailing zeroes. Now he wants to make one step further, look at the 3 digits right before the trailing zeroes. In the case of $12!$, the last 3 digits before the trailing zeroes are $016$.

-----Task-----
Given an integer $n$, find the last 3 digits before the trailing zeroes in $n!$. If there are fewer then 3 such digits, find all of them.

-----Input-----
The input contains one line with one integer $n$ ($1\leq n\leq 10000000$).

-----Output-----
Output one line with the 3 digits before trailing zeroes of $n!$. If there are fewer than 3 such digits, output all of them.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input:
5
Sample Output:
12
