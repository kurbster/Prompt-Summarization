Yes, we know $\ldots $ we’ve used Challenge $24$ before for contest problems. In case you’ve never heard of Challenge $24$ (or have a very short memory) the object of the game is to take $4$ given numbers (the base values) and determine if there is a way to produce the value $24$ from them using the four basic arithmetic operations (and parentheses if needed). For example, given the four base values 3 5 5 2, you can produce $24$ in many ways. Two of them are: 5*5-3+2 and (3+5)*(5-2). Recall that multiplication and division have precedence over addition and subtraction, and that equal-precedence operators are evaluated left-to-right.

This is all very familiar to most of you, but what you probably don’t know is that you can grade the quality of the expressions used to produce $24$. In fact, we’re sure you don’t know this since we’ve just made it up. Here’s how it works: A perfect grade for an expression is $0$. Each use of parentheses adds one point to the grade. Furthermore, each inversion (that is, a swap of two adjacent values) of the original ordering of the four base values adds two points. The first expression above has a grade of $4$, since two inversions are used to move the $3$ to the third position. The second expression has a better grade of $2$ since it uses no inversions but two sets of parentheses. As a further example, the initial set of four base values 3 6 2 3 could produce an expression of grade $3$ — namely (3+6+3)*2 — but it also has a perfect grade $0$ expression — namely 3*6+2*3. Needless to say, the lower the grade the “better” the expression.

Two additional rules we’ll use: $1$) you cannot use unary minus in any expression, so you can’t take the base values 3 5 5 2 and produce the expression -3+5*5+2, and $2$) division can only be used if the result is an integer, so you can’t take the base values 2 3 4 9 and produce the expression 2/3*4*9.

Given a sequence of base values, determine the lowest graded expression resulting in the value $24$. And by the way, the initial set of base values 3 5 5 2 has a grade $1$ expression — can you find it?
