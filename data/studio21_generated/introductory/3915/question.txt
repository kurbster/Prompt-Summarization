In elementary arithmetic a "carry" is a digit that is transferred from one column of digits to another column of more significant digits during a calculation algorithm.

This Kata is about determining the number of carries performed during the addition of multi-digit numbers.

You will receive an input string containing a set of pairs of numbers formatted as follows:

```
123 456
555 555
123 594
```

And your output should be a string formatted as follows:

```
No carry operation
1 carry operations
3 carry operations
```

###Some Assumptions

- Assume that numbers can be of any length.
- But both numbers in the pair will be of the same length.
- Although not all the numbers in the set need to be of the same length.
- If a number is shorter, it will be zero-padded.
- The input may contain any arbitrary number of pairs.
