Write a function that returns the count of characters that have to be removed in order to get a string with no consecutive repeats.

*Note:* This includes any characters

##  Examples

```python
'abbbbc'  => 'abc'    #  answer: 3
'abbcca'  => 'abca'   #  answer: 2
'ab cca'  => 'ab ca'  #  answer: 1
```
