 Consider the word `"abode"`. We can see that the letter `a` is in position `1` and `b` is in position `2`. In the alphabet, `a` and `b` are also in positions `1` and `2`. Notice also that `d` and `e` in `abode` occupy the positions they would occupy in the alphabet, which are positions `4` and `5`.  Given an array of words, return an array of the number of letters that occupy their positions in the alphabet for each word.
