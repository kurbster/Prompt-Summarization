Write
```python
function repeating_fractions(numerator, denominator)
```
that given two numbers representing the numerator and denominator of a fraction, return the fraction in string format. If the fractional part has repeated digits, replace those digits with a single digit in parentheses. 

For example:
```python
repeating_fractions(1,1) === '1'
repeating_fractions(1,3) === '0.(3)'
repeating_fractions(2,888) === '0.(0)(2)5(2)5(2)5(2)5(2)5(2)'
```
