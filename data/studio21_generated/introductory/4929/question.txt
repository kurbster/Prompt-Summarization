## Decode the diagonal. 

Given a grid of characters. Output a decoded message as a string.

Input

```
  H Z R R Q
  D I F C A E A !
  G H T E L A E 
  L M N H P R F 
  X Z R P E
```
  
Output

`HITHERE!` (diagonally down right `↘` and diagonally up right `↗` if you can't go further).

The message ends when there is no space at the right up or down diagonal.

To make things even clearer: the same example, but in a simplified view

```
  H _ _ _ _
  _ I _ _ _ _ _ !
  _ _ T _ _ _ E 
  _ _ _ H _ R _
  _ _ _ _ E
```
