Make a program that takes a value (x) and returns "Bang" if the number is divisible by 3, "Boom" if it is divisible by 5, "BangBoom" if it divisible by 3 and 5, and "Miss" if it isn't divisible by any of them.
Note: Your program should only return one value

Ex: Input: 105 --> Output: "BangBoom"
Ex: Input: 9 --> Output: "Bang"
Ex:Input: 25 --> Output: "Boom"
