This kata requires you to convert minutes (`int`) to hours and minutes in the format `hh:mm` (`string`).

If the input is `0` or negative value, then you should return `"00:00"`

**Hint:** use the modulo operation to solve this challenge. The modulo operation simply returns the remainder after a division. For example the remainder of 5 / 2 is 1, so 5 modulo 2 is 1.


## Example

If the input is `78`, then you should return `"01:18"`, because 78 minutes converts to 1 hour and 18 minutes.


Good luck! :D
