Given a string of words and numbers. Extract the expression including: 
1. the operator: either addition or subtraction
2. the two numbers that we are operating on

Return the result of the calculation.

Example:

"Panda has 48 apples and loses 4" returns 44

"Jerry has 34 apples and gains 6" returns 40

"loses" and "gains" are the only two words describing operators.

Should be a nice little kata for you :)

Note:
No fruit debts nor bitten apples = The numbers are integers and no negatives
