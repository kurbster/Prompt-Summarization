Given two integer arrays where the second array is a shuffled duplicate of the first array with one element missing, find the missing element.

Please note, there may be duplicates in the arrays, so checking if a numerical value exists in one and not the other is not a valid solution.

```
find_missing([1, 2, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]) => 2
```
```
find_missing([6, 1, 3, 6, 8, 2], [3, 6, 6, 1, 2]) => 8
```

The first array will always have at least one element.
