## Your task

You are given a dictionary/hash/object containing some languages and your test results in the given languages. Return the list of languages where your test score is at least `60`, in descending order of the results.

Note: the scores will always be unique (so no duplicate values)

## Examples

```python
{"Java": 10, "Ruby": 80, "Python": 65}    -->  ["Ruby", "Python"]
{"Hindi": 60, "Dutch" : 93, "Greek": 71}  -->  ["Dutch", "Greek", "Hindi"]
{"C++": 50, "ASM": 10, "Haskell": 20}     -->  []
```
