 Given two arrays of integers(`arr1`,`arr2`). Your task is going to find a pair of numbers(an element in arr1, and another element in arr2), their difference is as big as possible(absolute value); Again, you should to find a pair of numbers, their difference is as small as possible. Return the maximum and minimum difference values by an array: `[  max difference,  min difference  ]`  For example:  ```  Given arr1 = [3,10,5], arr2 =
