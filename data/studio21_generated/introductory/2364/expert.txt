 You are given an undirected unweighted graph consisting of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges (which represents the map of Bertown) and the array of prices $p$ of length $m$. It is guaranteed that there is a path between each pair of vertices (districts). Mike has planned a trip from the vertex (district) $a$ to the vertex (district) $b$ and then from the vertex (district) $b$ to the vertex (district) $c$. He can visit the same district twice or more.
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow. The first line of the test case contains five integers $n, m, a, b$ and $c$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $n-1 \le m \le min(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5)$, $1 \le a, b, c \le n$) — the number of vertices, the number of edges and districts in Mike's trip. The second line of the test case contains $m$ integers $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_m$ ($1 \le p_i \le 10^9$), where $p_i$ is the $i$-th price from the array. The following $m$ lines of the test case denote edges: edge $i$ is represented by a pair of integers $v_i$, $u_i$ ($1 \le v_i, u_i \le n$, $u_i \ne v_i$), which are the indices of vertices connected by the edge. There are no loops or multiple edges in the given graph, i. e. for each pair ($v_i, u_i$) there are no other pairs ($v_i, u_i$) or ($u_i, v_i$) in the array of edges, and for each pair $(v_i, u_i)$ the condition $v_i \ne u_i$ is satisfied. It is guaranteed that the given graph is connected. It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ (as well as the sum of $m$) does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$ ($\sum n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $\sum m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$). -----Output----- For each test case, print the answer — the minimum possible price of Mike's trip if you distribute prices between edges optimally. -----Example----- Input 2 4 3 2 3 4 1 2 3 1 2 1 3 1 4 7 9 1 5 7 2 10 4 8 5 6 7 3 3 1 2 1 3 1 4 3 2 3 5 4 2 5 6 1 7 6 7 Output 7 12 -----Note----- One of the possible solution to the first test case of the example: [Image] One of the possible solution to the second test case of the example: [Image]
