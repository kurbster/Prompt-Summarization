 Given two strings, the first being a random string and the second being the same as the first, but with three added characters somewhere in the string (three same characters), Write a function that returns the added character ### E.g ``` string1 = "hello" string2 = "aaahello" // => 'a' ``` The above is just an example; the characters could be anywhere in the string and string2 is actually **shuffled**. ### Another example ``` string1 = "abcde" string2 = "2db2a2ec" // => '2' ```
