=====Problem Statement=====
The provided code stub reads two integers, a and b, from STDIN.
Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division,
a // b. The second line should contain the result of float division, a / b.
No rounding or formatting is necessary.

=====Example=====
a = 3
b = 5
The result of the integer division 3//5 = 0.
The result of the float division is 3/5 = 0.6. 

Print:
0
0.6

=====Input Format=====
The first line contains the first integer, a.
The second line contains the second integer, b.

=====Output Format=====
Print the two lines as described above.
