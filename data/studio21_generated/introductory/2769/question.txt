# Task
 Consider the following ciphering algorithm:
```
For each character replace it with its code.
Concatenate all of the obtained numbers.
```
Given a ciphered string, return the initial one if it is known that it consists only of lowercase letters.

 Note: here the character's code means its `decimal ASCII code`, the numerical representation of a character used by most modern programming languages.

# Example

 For `cipher = "10197115121"`, the output should be `"easy"`.

 Explanation: 
 ```
 charCode('e') = 101, 
 charCode('a') = 97, 
 charCode('s') = 115 
 charCode('y') = 121.
```
# Input/Output


 - `[input]` string `cipher`

   A non-empty string which is guaranteed to be a cipher for some other string of lowercase letters.


 - `[output]` a string
