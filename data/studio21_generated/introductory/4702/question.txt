# Task
 Given an integer `product`, find the smallest positive integer the product of whose digits is equal to product. If there is no such integer, return -1 instead.

# Example

 For `product = 1`, the output should be `11`;
 
 `1 x 1 = 1` (1 is not a valid result, because it has only 1 digit)
 
 For `product = 12`, the output should be `26`;
 
 `2 x 6 = 12`
 
 For `product = 19`, the output should be `-1`.
 
 No valid result found.
 
 For `product = 450`, the output should be `2559`.
 
 `2 x 5 x 5 x 9 = 450`
 
 For `product = 581`, the output should be `-1`.
 
 No valid result found. 
 
 Someone says the output should be `783`, because `7 x 83 = 581`.
 
 Please note: `83` is not a **DIGIT**.
 
# Input/Output


 - `[input]` integer `product`

    Constraints: `0 ≤ product ≤ 600`.


 - `[output]` a positive integer
