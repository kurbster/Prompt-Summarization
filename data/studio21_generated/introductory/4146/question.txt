Complete the method which accepts an array of integers, and returns one of the following:

* `"yes, ascending"` - if the numbers in the array are sorted in an ascending order
* `"yes, descending"` - if the numbers in the array are sorted in a descending order
* `"no"` - otherwise


You can assume the array will always be valid, and there will always be one correct answer.
