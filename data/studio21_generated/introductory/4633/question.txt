You have to create a function that converts integer given as string into ASCII uppercase letters.

All ASCII characters have their numerical order in table. 

For example,

```
from ASCII table, character of number 65 is "A".
```

Numbers will be next to each other, So you have to split given number to two digit long integers.

For example, 

```
'658776' to [65, 87, 76] and then turn it into 'AWL'.
```
