=====Problem Statement=====
You are given a set A and n other sets.
Your job is to find whether set A is a strict superset of each of the N sets.
Print True, if A is a strict superset of each of the N sets. Otherwise, print False.
A strict superset has at least one element that does not exist in its subset.

=====Example=====
Set([1,3,4]) is a strict superset of set([1,3]).
Set([1,3,4]) is not a strict superset of set([1,3,4]).
Set([1,3,4]) is not a strict superset of set(1,3,5).

=====Input Format=====
The first line contains the space separated elements of set A.
The second line contains integer n, the number of other sets.
The next n lines contains the space separated elements of the other sets.

=====Constraints=====
0 < len(set(A)) < 501
0<N<21
0 < len(otherSets) < 101

=====Output Format=====
Print True if set A is a strict superset of all other N sets. Otherwise, print False.
