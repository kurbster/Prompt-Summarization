You are standing on top of an amazing Himalayan mountain. The view is absolutely breathtaking! you want to take a picture on your phone, but... your memory is full again! ok, time to sort through your shuffled photos and make some space...

Given a gallery of photos, write a function to sort through your pictures.
You get a random hard disk drive full of pics, you must return an array with the 5 most recent ones PLUS the next one (same year and number following the one of the last).

You will always get at least a photo and all pics will be in the format `YYYY.imgN`

Examples:
```python
sort_photos["2016.img1","2016.img2","2015.img3","2016.img4","2013.img5"]) ==["2013.img5","2015.img3","2016.img1","2016.img2","2016.img4","2016.img5"]
sort_photos["2016.img1"]) ==["2016.img1","2016.img2"]
```
