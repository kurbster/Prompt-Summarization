DropCaps means that the first letter of the starting word of the paragraph should be in caps and the remaining lowercase, just like you see in the newspaper. 

But for a change, let's do that for each and every word of the given String. Your task is to capitalize every word that has length greater than 2, leaving smaller words as they are.

*should work also on Leading and Trailing Spaces and caps.

```python
drop_cap('apple') => "Apple"
drop_cap('apple of banana'); => "Apple of Banana"
drop_cap('one   space'); => "One   Space" 
drop_cap('   space WALK   '); => "   Space Walk   " 
```

**Note:** you will be provided atleast one word and should take string as input and return string as output.
