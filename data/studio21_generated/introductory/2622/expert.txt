 You are given an array with n integers. There are also 2 disjoint sets, A and B, each containing m integers. You like all the integers in set A and dislike all the integers in set B. Your initial happiness is 0. For each integer i in the array, if i   A, you add 1 to your happiness. If i   B, you add -1 to your happiness. Otherwise, your happiness does not change. Output your final happiness at the end. Note: Since A and B are sets, they have no repeated elements. However, the array might contain duplicate elements. =====
=====Input Format===== The first line contains integers n and m separated by a space. The second line contains n integers, the elements of the array. The third and fourth lines contain m integers, A and B, respectively. =====Output Format===== Output a single integer, your total happiness.
