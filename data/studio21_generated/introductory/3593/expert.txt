 Given a string and an array of integers representing indices, capitalize all letters at the given indices.  For example: * `capitalize("abcdef",[1,2,5]) = "aBCdeF"` * `capitalize("abcdef",[1,2,5,100]) = "aBCdeF"`. There is no index 100. The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces and an array of digits. Note: You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters.
