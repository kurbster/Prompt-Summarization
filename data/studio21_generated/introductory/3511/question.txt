Hector the hacker has stolen some information, but it is encrypted. In order to decrypt it, he needs to write a function that will generate a decryption key from the encryption key which he stole (it is in hexadecimal). To do this, he has to determine the two prime factors `P` and `Q` of the encyption key, and return the product `(P-1) * (Q-1)`.

**Note:** the primes used are < 10^(5)

## Examples

For example if the encryption key is `"47b"`, it is 1147 in decimal. This factors to 31\*37, so the key Hector needs is 1080 (= 30\*36).


More examples:
* input: `"2533"`, result: 9328 (primes: 89, 107)
* input: `"1ba9"`, result: 6912 (primes: 73, 97)
