> [Run-length encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Run-length_encoding) (RLE) is a very simple form of data compression in which runs of data (that is, sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run. Wikipedia

## Task

Your task is to write such a run-length encoding. For a given string, return a list (or array) of pairs (or arrays) 
[
 (i1, s1),
 (i2, s2),
 …,
 (in, sn)
], such that one can reconstruct the original string by replicating the character sx ix times and concatening all those strings. Your run-length encoding should be minimal, ie. for all i the values si and si+1 should differ.

## Examples

As the article states, RLE is a _very_ simple form of data compression. It's only suitable for runs of data, as one can see in the following example:

```python
run_length_encoding("hello world!")
 //=>      [[1,'h'], [1,'e'], [2,'l'], [1,'o'], [1,' '], [1,'w'], [1,'o'], [1,'r'], [1,'l'], [1,'d'], [1,'!']]
```

It's very effective if the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements:
```python
run_length_encoding("aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbb")
# => [[34,'a'], [3,'b']]
```
