 You are given a zero-indexed array arr consisting of n integers. The dominator of array arr is the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of arr. For example, consider array arr such that arr = [3,4,3,2,3,1,3,3] The dominator of arr is 3 because it occurs in 5 out of 8 elements of arr and 5 is more than a half of 8. Write a function dominator(arr) that, given a zero-indexed array arr consisting of n integers, returns the dominator of arr.
