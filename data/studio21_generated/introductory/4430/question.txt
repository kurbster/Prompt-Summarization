Write a function 

```python
vowel_2_index```

that takes in a string and replaces all the vowels [a,e,i,o,u] with their respective positions within that string. 
E.g: 

```python
vowel_2_index('this is my string') == 'th3s 6s my str15ng'
vowel_2_index('Codewars is the best site in the world') == 'C2d4w6rs 10s th15 b18st s23t25 27n th32 w35rld'
vowel_2_index('') == ''
```
 Your function should be case insensitive to the vowels.
