Consider an array that has no prime numbers, and none of its elements has any prime digit. It would start with: `[1,4,6,8,9,10,14,16,18,..]`. 

`12` and `15` are not in the list because `2` and `5` are primes.

You will be given an integer `n` and your task will be return the number at that index in the array. 
For example:
```
solve(0) = 1
solve(2) = 6
``` 

More examples in the test cases.

Good luck!
