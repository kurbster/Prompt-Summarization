=====Problem Statement=====
A valid email address meets the following criteria:

It's composed of a username, domain name, and extension assembled in this format: username@domain.extension
The username starts with an English alphabetical character, and any subsequent characters consist of one or more of the following: alphanumeric characters, -,., and _.
The domain and extension contain only English alphabetical characters.
The extension is 1, 2, or 3 characters in length.

Given n pairs of names and email addresses as input, print each name and email address pair having a valid email address on a new line.

Hint: Try using Email.utils() to complete this challenge. For example, this code:

import email.utils
print email.utils.parseaddr('DOSHI <DOSHI@hackerrank.com>')
print email.utils.formataddr(('DOSHI', 'DOSHI@hackerrank.com'))

produces this output:

('DOSHI', 'DOSHI@hackerrank.com')
DOSHI <DOSHI@hackerrank.com>

=====Input Format=====
The first line contains a single integer, n, denoting the number of email address.
Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains a name and an email address as two space-separated values following this format:
name <user@email.com>

=====Constraints=====
0<n<100

=====Output Format=====
Print the space-separated name and email address pairs containing valid email addresses only. Each pair must be printed on a new line in the following format:
name <user@email.com>

You must print each valid email address in the same order as it was received as input.
