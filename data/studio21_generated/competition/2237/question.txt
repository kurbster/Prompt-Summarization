You are given a permutation $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$.

In one move you can swap two adjacent values.

You want to perform a minimum number of moves, such that in the end there will exist a subsegment $1,2,\ldots, k$, in other words in the end there should be an integer $i$, $1 \leq i \leq n-k+1$ such that $p_i = 1, p_{i+1} = 2, \ldots, p_{i+k-1}=k$.

Let $f(k)$ be the minimum number of moves that you need to make a subsegment with values $1,2,\ldots,k$ appear in the permutation.

You need to find $f(1), f(2), \ldots, f(n)$.


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 200\,000$): the number of elements in the permutation.

The next line of input contains $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$: given permutation ($1 \leq p_i \leq n$).


-----Output-----

Print $n$ integers, the minimum number of moves that you need to make a subsegment with values $1,2,\ldots,k$ appear in the permutation, for $k=1, 2, \ldots, n$.
