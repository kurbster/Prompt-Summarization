Let's assume that   v(n) is the largest prime number, that does not exceed n;

 u(n) is the smallest prime number strictly greater than n. 

Find $\sum_{i = 2}^{n} \frac{1}{v(i) u(i)}$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) — the number of testscases. 

Each of the following t lines of the input contains integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print t lines: the i-th of them must contain the answer to the i-th test as an irreducible fraction "p/q", where p, q are integers, q > 0.
