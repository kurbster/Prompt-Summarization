Let x be a string of length at least 1.
We will call x a good string, if for any string y and any integer k (k \geq 2), the string obtained by concatenating k copies of y is different from x.
For example, a, bbc and cdcdc are good strings, while aa, bbbb and cdcdcd are not.
Let w be a string of length at least 1.
For a sequence F=(\,f_1,\,f_2,\,...,\,f_m) consisting of m elements,
we will call F a good representation of w, if the following conditions are both satisfied:
 - For any i \, (1 \leq i \leq m), f_i is a good string.
 - The string obtained by concatenating f_1,\,f_2,\,...,\,f_m in this order, is w.
For example, when w=aabb, there are five good representations of w:
 - (aabb)
 - (a,abb)
 - (aab,b)
 - (a,ab,b)
 - (a,a,b,b)
Among the good representations of w, the ones with the smallest number of elements are called the best representations of w.
For example, there are only one best representation of w=aabb: (aabb).
You are given a string w. Find the following:
 - the number of elements of a best representation of w
 - the number of the best representations of w, modulo 1000000007 \, (=10^9+7)
(It is guaranteed that a good representation of w always exists.)

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq |w| \leq 500000 \, (=5 \times 10^5)
 - w consists of lowercase letters (a-z).

-----Partial Score-----
 - 400 points will be awarded for passing the test set satisfying 1 \leq |w| \leq 4000.

-----Input-----
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
w

-----Output-----

 - In the second line, print the number of the best representations of w, modulo 1000000007.

-----Sample Input-----
