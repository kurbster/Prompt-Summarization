 Given a list of folders, remove all sub-folders in those folders and return in any order the folders after removing. If a folder[i] is located within another folder[j], it is called a sub-folder of it. The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: / followed by one or more lowercase English letters. For example, /leetcode and /leetcode/problems are valid paths while an empty string and / are not.   Example 1: Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b","/c
