Polycarp wants to assemble his own keyboard. Layouts with multiple rows are too complicated for him — his keyboard will consist of only one row, where all $26$ lowercase Latin letters will be arranged in some order.

Polycarp uses the same password $s$ on all websites where he is registered (it is bad, but he doesn't care). He wants to assemble a keyboard that will allow to type this password very easily. He doesn't like to move his fingers while typing the password, so, for each pair of adjacent characters in $s$, they should be adjacent on the keyboard. For example, if the password is abacaba, then the layout cabdefghi... is perfect, since characters a and c are adjacent on the keyboard, and a and b are adjacent on the keyboard. It is guaranteed that there are no two adjacent equal characters in $s$, so, for example, the password cannot be password (two characters s are adjacent).

Can you help Polycarp with choosing the perfect layout of the keyboard, if it is possible?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 1000$) — the number of test cases.

Then $T$ lines follow, each containing one string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 200$) representing the test case. $s$ consists of lowercase Latin letters only. There are no two adjacent equal characters in $s$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, do the following:

  if it is impossible to assemble a perfect keyboard, print NO (in upper case, it matters in this problem);  otherwise, print YES (in upper case), and then a string consisting of $26$ lowercase Latin letters — the perfect layout. Each Latin letter should appear in this string exactly once. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
