 Given two strings s1 and s2, your task is to compare them lexicographically. Note: Letters are case insensitive. 
-----Input----- First line contains a integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains two strings of equal size in two separate lines. -----Output----- For each test case, If s1 < s2, print "first". If s1 > s2, print "second". If s1=s2, print "equal". in separate lines. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^2 - 1 ≤ Length of the string ≤ 500 -----Example----- Input: 2 abc acb AB ba Output: first first
