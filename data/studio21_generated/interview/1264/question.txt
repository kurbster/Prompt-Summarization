Mohit's girlfriend is playing a game with Nicky. The description of the game is as follows:
- Initially on a table Player 1 will put N gem-stones.
- Players will play alternatively, turn by turn.
- At each move a player can take at most M gem-stones (at least 1 gem-stone must be taken) from the available gem-stones on the table.(Each gem-stone has same cost.)
- Each players gem-stone are gathered in player's side.
- The player that empties the table purchases food from it (using all his gem-stones; one gem-stone can buy one unit of food), and the other one puts all his gem-stones back on to the table. Again the game continues with the "loser" player starting.
- The game continues until all the gem-stones are used to buy food.
- The main objective of the game is to consume maximum units of food.
