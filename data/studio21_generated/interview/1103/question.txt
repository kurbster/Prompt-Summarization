Leha is a bright mathematician. Today he is investigating whether an integer is divisible by some square number or not.
He has a positive integer X represented as a product of N integers a1, a2, .... aN. He has somehow figured out that there exists some integer P such that the number X is divisible by P2, but he is not able to find such P himself. Can you find it for him? If there are more than one possible values of P possible, you can print any one of them.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains one integer N denoting the number of intgers in presentation of X.
The second line contains N space-separated integers a1, a2, .... aN.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single integer P deoting the answer for this test case. Note that P must be in range from 2 to 1018 inclusive. It's guaranteed that at least one answer exists. If there are more than one possible answers, print any.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 5
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ ai ≤ 1018

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1[19 points]: 1 ≤ a1*a2*...*aN ≤ 106
- Subtask 2[22 points]: 1 ≤ a1*a2*...*aN ≤ 1012
- Subtask 3[23 points]: 1 ≤ ai ≤ 1012
- Subtask 4[36 points]: no additional constraints

-----Example-----
Input:
1
3
21 11 6

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1. X = 21 * 11 * 6 = 1386. It's divisible by 9 which is a square number, as 9 = 32. So P = 3.
