 
Example 1: Input: [[1],[2],[3],[]] Output: true Explanation:   We start in room 0, and pick up key 1. We then go to room 1, and pick up key 2. We then go to room 2, and pick up key 3. We then go to room 3.  Since we were able to go to every room, we return true. Example 2: Input: [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]] Output: false Explanation: We can't enter the room with number 2. Note: 1 <= rooms.length <= 1000 0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000 The number of keys in all rooms combined is at most 3000.
