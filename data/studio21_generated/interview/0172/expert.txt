 You are given an integer num. You will apply the following steps exactly two times: Pick a digit x (0 <= x <= 9). Pick another digit y (0 <= y <= 9). The digit y can be equal to x. Replace all the occurrences of x in the decimal representation of num by y. The new integer cannot have any leading zeros, also the new integer cannot be 0. Let a and b be the results of applying the operations to num the first and second times, respectively. Return the max difference between a and b.   Example 1: Input:
