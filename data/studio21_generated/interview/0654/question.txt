	Three numbers A, B and C are the inputs. Write a program to find second largest among them.

-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer T, the total number of testcases. Then T lines follow, each line contains three integers A, B and C. 

-----Output-----
For each test case, display the second largest among A, B and C, in a new line.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ A,B,C ≤ 1000000
