 You are given a list of integers. For each integer in the list, you need to calculate the number of occurrences of the digit 4 in the decimal representation. 
-----Input----- The first line of input consists of a single integer T, denoting the number of integers in Kostya's list. Then, there are T lines, each of them contain a single integer from the list. -----Output----- Output T lines. Each of these lines should contain the number of occurences of the digit 4 in the respective integer from Kostya's list. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 105 - (Subtask 1): 0 ≤ Numbers from the list  ≤ 9 - 33 points. - (Subtask 2): 0 ≤ Numbers from the list  ≤ 109 - 67 points. -----Example----- Input: 5 447474 228 6664 40 81 Output: 4 0 1 1 0
