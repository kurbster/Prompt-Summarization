 Given an array of integers arr. We want to select three indices i, j and k where (0 <= i < j <= k < arr.length). Let's define a and b as follows: a = arr[i] ^ arr[i + 1] ^ ... ^ arr[j - 1] b = arr[j] ^ arr[j + 1] ^ ... ^ arr[k] Note that ^ denotes the bitwise-xor operation. Return the number of triplets (i, j and k) Where a == b.
