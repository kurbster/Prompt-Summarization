 A kingdom consists of a king, his children, his grandchildren, and so on. Every once in a while, someone in the family dies or a child is born. The kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the first member. Let's define the recursive function Successor(x, curOrder), which given a person x and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after x in the order of inheritance. Successor(x, curOrder):     if x has no children or all of x's children are in curOrder:         if x is the king return null         else return Successor
