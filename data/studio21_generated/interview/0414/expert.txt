 Given an integer array and integer k. A game will be played between the first two elements of the array. In each round of the game, we compare arr[0] with arr[1], the larger integer wins and remains at position 0 and the smaller integer moves to the end of the array. The game ends when an integer wins k consecutive rounds. Return the integer which will win the game. It is guaranteed that there will be a winner of the game.
