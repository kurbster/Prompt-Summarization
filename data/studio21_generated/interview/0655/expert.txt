 You are given a sequence of positive integers with length $N + K$. You managed to calculate the arithmetic average of all elements of this sequence (let's denote it by $V$), but then, your little brother deleted $K$ elements from this sequence. All deleted elements had the same value. You still know the remaining $N$ elements (a sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$). Help him with restoring the original sequence by finding the value of the deleted elements or deciding that there is some mistake and the described scenario is impossible. Note that the if it is possible for the deleted
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $N$, $K$ and $V$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the value of the deleted elements, or $-1$ if there is a mistake. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 100$ - $1 \le N, K \le 100$ - $1 \le V \le 10^5$ - $1 \le A_i \le 10^5$ for each valid $i$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 3 3 3 4 2 7 3 3 1 4 7 6 5 3 3 4 2 8 3 -----Example Output----- 4 -1 -1
