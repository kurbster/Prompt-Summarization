Given an array A of length N, your task is to find the element which repeats in A maximum number of times as well as the corresponding count. In case of ties, choose the smaller element first.

-----Input-----
First line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then follows description of T cases. Each case begins with a single integer N, the length of A. Then follow N space separated integers in next line.  Assume that 1 <= T <= 100, 1 <= N <= 100 and for all i in [1..N] : 1 <= A[i] <= 10000

-----Output-----
For each test case, output two space separated integers V & C. V is the value which occurs maximum number of times and C is its count.

-----Example-----
Input:
2
5
1 2 3 2 5
6
1 2 2 1 1 2

Output:
2 2
1 3

Description:
In first case 2 occurs twice whereas all other elements occur only once. 
In second case, both 1 and 2 occur 3 times but 1 is smaller than 2.
