Recently, Chef studied the binary numeral system and noticed that it is extremely simple to perform bitwise operations like AND, XOR or bit shift on non-negative integers, while it is much more complicated to perform arithmetic operations (e.g. addition, multiplication or division).
After playing with binary operations for a while, Chef invented an interesting algorithm for addition of two non-negative integers $A$ and $B$:
function add(A, B):
while B is greater than 0:
U = A XOR B
V = A AND B
A = U
B = V * 2
return A

Now Chef is wondering how fast this algorithm is. Given the initial values of $A$ and $B$ (in binary representation), he needs you to help him compute the number of times the while-loop of the algorithm is repeated.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single string $A$.
- The second line contains a single string $B$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of iterations the algorithm will perform during addition of the given numbers $A$ and $B$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le |A|, |B| \le 10^5$
- $A$ and $B$ contain only characters '0' and '1'
- the sum of $|A| + |B|$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (20 points): $|A|, |B| \le 30$
Subtask #2 (30 points):
- $|A|, |B| \le 500$
- the sum of $|A| + |B|$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$
Subtask #3 (50 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
3
100010
0
0
100010
11100
1010

-----Example Output-----
0
1
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: The initial value of $B$ is $0$, so while-loop is not performed at all.
Example case 2: The initial values of $A$ and $B$ are $0_2 = 0$ and $100010_2 = 34$ respectively. When the while-loop is performed for the first time, we have:
- $U = 34$
- $V = 0$
- $A$ changes to $34$
- $B$ changes to $2 \cdot 0 = 0$
The while-loop terminates immediately afterwards, so it is executed only once.
Example case 3: The initial values of $A$ and $B$ are $11100_2 = 28$ and $1010_2 = 10$ respectively. After the first iteration, their values change to $22$ and $16$ respectively. After the second iteration, they change to $6$ and $32$, and finally, after the third iteration, to $38$ and $0$.
