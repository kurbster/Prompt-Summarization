## Task

You are at position `[0, 0]` in maze NxN and you can **only** move in one of the four cardinal directions (i.e. North, East, South, West). Return the minimal number of steps to exit position `[N-1, N-1]` *if* it is possible to reach the exit from the starting position.  Otherwise, return `false` in **JavaScript**/**Python** and `-1` in **C++**/**C#**/**Java**.

Empty positions are marked `.`.  Walls are marked `W`.  Start and exit positions are guaranteed to be empty in all test cases.
