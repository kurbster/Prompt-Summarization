Chef is a very experienced and well-known cook. He has participated in many cooking competitions in the past — so many that he does not even remember them all.
One of these competitions lasted for a certain number of days. The first day of the competition was day $S$ of the week (i.e. Monday, Tuesday etc.) and the last day was day $E$ of the week. Chef remembers that the duration of the competition (the number of days between the first and last day, inclusive) was between $L$ days and $R$ days inclusive. Is it possible to uniquely determine the exact duration of the competition? If so, what is this duration?

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated strings $S$ and $E$, followed by a space and two space-separated integers $L$ and $R$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing:
- the string "impossible" if there is no duration consistent with all given information
- the string "many" if there is more than one possible duration
- one integer — the duration of the competition, if its duration is unique

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 10,000$
- $1 \le L \le R \le 100$
- $S$ is one of the strings "saturday", "sunday", "monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday" or "friday"
- $E$ is one of the strings "saturday", "sunday", "monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday" or "friday"
