 You are given an array arr of length n where arr[i] = (2 * i) + 1 for all valid values of i (i.e. 0 <= i < n). In one operation, you can select two indices x and y where 0 <= x, y < n and subtract 1 from arr[x] and add 1 to arr[y] (i.e. perform arr[x] -=1 and arr[y] += 1). The goal is to make all the elements of the array equal. It is guaranteed that
