 You are given an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again). Example 1: Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4] Output: 6 Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
