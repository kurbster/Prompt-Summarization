 Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions. Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again). Example 1: Input: [2,4,1], k = 2 Output: 2 Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
