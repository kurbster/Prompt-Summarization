 You have to find the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to N.  For example, 2,3,5,7,11 and 13 are primes.  Recall that a number is prime if it's only divisors are 1 and itself, and it is greater than 1.  For example, 2,3,5,7,11 and 13 are primes.  Recall that a number is a palindrome if it reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left.  For example, 12321 is a palindrome.
