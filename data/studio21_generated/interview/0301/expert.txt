 you are given two arrays A and B. Return the maximum number of connecting lines you can draw between them. 
Example 1: Input: A = [1,4,2], B = [1,2,4] Output: 2 Explanation: We can draw 2 uncrossed lines as in the diagram. We cannot draw 3 uncrossed lines, because the line from A[1]=4 to B[2]=4 will intersect the line from A[2]=2 to B[1]=2. Example 2: Input: A = [2,5,1,2,5], B = [10,5,2,1,5,2] Output: 3 Example 3: Input: A = [1,3,7,1,7,5], B = [1,9,2,5,1] Output: 2   Note: 1 <= A.length <= 500 1 <= B.length <= 500 1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 2000
