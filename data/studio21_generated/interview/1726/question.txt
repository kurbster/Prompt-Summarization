## Task

You are at position [0, 0] in maze NxN and you can **only** move in one of the four cardinal directions (i.e. North, East, South, West).  Return `true` if you can reach position [N-1, N-1] or `false` otherwise.

Empty positions are marked `.`. Walls are marked `W`. Start and exit positions are empty in all test cases.
