 Given a non-empty array of unique positive integers A, consider the following graph: There are A.length nodes, labelled A[0] to A[A.length - 1]; There is an edge between A[i] and A[j] if and only if A[i] and A[j] share a common factor greater than 1. Return the size of the largest connected component in the graph.
