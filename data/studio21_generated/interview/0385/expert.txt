 You are given two positive integers n and k. A factor of an integer n is defined as an integer i where n % i == 0. Consider a list of all factors of n sorted in ascending order, return the kth factor in this list or return -1 if n has less than k factors.   Example 1: Input: n = 12, k = 3 Output: 3 Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12], the 3rd
