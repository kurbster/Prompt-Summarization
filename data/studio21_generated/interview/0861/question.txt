Recall the definition of the Fibonacci numbers:


f1 := 1

f2 := 2

fn := fn-1 + fn-2 (n>=3)

Given two numbers a and b, calculate how many Fibonacci numbers are in the range [a,b].


-----Input-----

The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of two non-negative integer numbers a and b. Input is terminated by a=b=0. Otherwise, a<=b<=10^100. The numbers a and b are given with no superfluous leading zeros.

-----Output-----

For each test case output on a single line the number of Fibonacci numbers fi with a<=fi<=b.

-----Example-----
Input:

10 100
1234567890 9876543210
0 0

Output:

5
4
