 Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST). Assume a BST is defined as follows:        The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.        The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.        Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. Example 1: Input:     2    / \   1   3 Output: true Example 2:     5
