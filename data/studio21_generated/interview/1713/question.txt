The aim of this kata is to determine the number of sub-function calls made by an unknown function.

You have to write a function named `count_calls` which:

* takes as parameter a function and its arguments (args, kwargs)
* calls the function
* returns a tuple containing:

 * the number of function calls made inside it and inside all the sub-called functions recursively
 * the function return value.

NB: The call to the function itself is not counted.

HINT: The sys module may come in handy.
