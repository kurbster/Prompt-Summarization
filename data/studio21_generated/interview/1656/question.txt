With your birthday coming up soon, your eccentric friend sent you a message to say "happy birthday":

    hhhappyyyy biirrrrrthddaaaayyyyyyy to youuuu
    hhapppyyyy biirtttthdaaay too youuu
    happy birrrthdayy to youuu
    happpyyyy birrtthdaaay tooooo youu

At first it looks like a song, but upon closer investigation, you realize that your friend hid the phrase "happy birthday" thousands of times inside his message. In fact, it contains it more than 2 million times! To thank him, you'd like to reply with exactly how many times it occurs.

To count all the occurences, the procedure is as follows: look through the paragraph and find a `'h'`; then find an `'a'` later in the paragraph; then find an `'p'` after that, and so on. Now count the number of ways in which you can choose letters in this way to make the full phrase.

More precisely, given a text string, you are to determine how many times the search string appears as a sub-sequence of that string.

Write a function called `countSubsequences` that takes two arguments: `needle`, the string to be search for and `haystack`, the string to search in. In our example, `"happy birthday"` is the needle and the birthday message is the haystack. The function should return the number of times `needle` occurs as a sub-sequence of `haystack`.  Spaces are also considered part of the needle.

Since the answers can be very large, return only the last 8 digits of the answer in case it exceeds 8 digits. The answers to the test cases will all be shorter than 8 digits.
