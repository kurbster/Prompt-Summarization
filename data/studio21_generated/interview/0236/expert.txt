 A string of '0's and '1's is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of '0's (possibly 0), followed by some number of '1's (also possibly 0.) We are given a string S of '0's and '1's, and we may flip any '0' to a '1' or a '1' to a '0'. Return the minimum number of flips to make S monotone increasing.   Example 1: Input: "00110" Output: 1 Explanation: We
