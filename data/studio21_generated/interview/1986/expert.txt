 Given 2 integers n and start. Your task is return any permutation p of (0,1,2.....,2^n -1) such that : p[0] = start p[i] and p[i+1] differ by only one bit in their binary representation. p[0] and p[2^n -1] must also differ by only one bit in their binary representation.   Example 1: Input: n = 2, start = 3 Output: [3,2
