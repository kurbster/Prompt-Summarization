$ $
The corresponding output would read as:
$ $
right this solve will you smart are you If problem
this illustrate to text of piece sample a is This

$ $
That is, the lines are printed in reverse order and in each line the words are printed in reverse order.

-----Input:-----
The first line of input contains a single integer $N$, indicating the number of lines in the input. This is followed by $N$ lines of input text.

-----Output:-----
