 Given a binary string s (a string consisting only of '0's and '1's), we can split s into 3 non-empty strings s1, s2, s3 (s1+ s2+ s3 = s). Return the number of ways s can be split such that the number of characters '1' is the same in s1, s2, and s3. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
