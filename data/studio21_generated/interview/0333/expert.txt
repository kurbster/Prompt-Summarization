 Given an array of integers arr, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array. In one step you can jump from index i to index: i + 1 where: i + 1 < arr.length. i - 1 where: i - 1 >= 0. j where: arr[i] == arr[j] and i != j. Return the minimum number of steps to reach the last index of the array. Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.   Example 1: Input: arr = [100,-23,-23,404,100
