 Given an integer array arr and an integer k, modify the array by repeating it k times. For example, if arr = [1, 2] and k = 3 then the modified array will be [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]. Return the maximum sub-array sum in the modified array. Note that the length of the sub-array can be 0 and its sum in that case is 0. As the answer can be very large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.   Example 1: Input:
