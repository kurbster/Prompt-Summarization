Given a rectangle of size n x m, find the minimum number of integer-sided squares that tile the rectangle.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 2, m = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 squares are necessary to cover the rectangle.
2 (squares of 1x1)
1 (square of 2x2)
Example 2:

Input: n = 5, m = 8
Output: 5

Example 3:

Input: n = 11, m = 13
Output: 6

 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 13
1 <= m <= 13
