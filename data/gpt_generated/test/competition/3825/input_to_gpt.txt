Task: Make a function that converts a word to pig latin. The rules of pig latin are: ``` If the word has more than 3 letters:   1. Take the first letter of a word and move it to the end   2. Add -ay to the word Otherwise leave the word alone. ```

Let's introduce a number system which is based on a roman digits. There are digits I, V, X, L which correspond to the numbers $1$, $5$, $10$ and $50$ respectively. The use of other roman digits is not allowed. Numbers in this system are written as a sequence of one or more digits. We define the value of the sequence simply as the sum of digits in it. For example, the number XXXV evaluates to $35$ and the number IXI   to $12$. Pay attention to the difference to the traditional roman system   in our system any sequence of digits is valid, moreover the order of digits doesn't matter, for example IX means $11$, not $9$. One can notice that this system is ambiguous, and some numbers can be written in many different ways. Your goal is to determine how many distinct integers can be represented by exactly $n$ roman digits I, V, X, L.
