We have a string S of length N consisting of A, B, and C.
You can do the following operation on S zero or more times:
 - Choose i (1 \leq i \leq |S| - 1) such that S_i \neq S_{i + 1}. Replace S_i with the character (among A, B, and C) that is different from both S_i and S_{i + 1}, and remove S_{i + 1} from S.
Find the number of distinct strings that S can be after zero or more operations, and print the count modulo (10^9+7).

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^6
 - S is a string of length N consisting of A, B, and C.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S

-----Output-----
Print the number of distinct strings that S can be after zero or more operations, modulo (10^9+7).

-----Sample Input-----
5
ABAAC

-----Sample Output-----
11

For example, the following sequence of operations turns S into ACB:
 - First, choose i=2. We replace S_2 with C and remove S_3, turning S into ACAC.
 - Then, choose i=3. We replace S_3 with B and remove S_4, turning S into ACB.
