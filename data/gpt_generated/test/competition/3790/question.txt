You are given an array of positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} × T of length n × T. We know that for any i > n it is true that a_{i} = a_{i} - n. Find the length of the longest non-decreasing sequence of the given array.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated integers: n, T (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^7). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 300).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the length of a sought sequence.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3
3 1 4 2

Output
5



-----Note-----

The array given in the sample looks like that: 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2. The elements in bold form the largest non-decreasing subsequence.
