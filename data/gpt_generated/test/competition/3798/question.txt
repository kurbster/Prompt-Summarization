For integers b (b \geq 2) and n (n \geq 1), let the function f(b,n) be defined as follows:
 - f(b,n) = n, when n < b
 - f(b,n) = f(b,\,{\rm floor}(n / b)) + (n \ {\rm mod} \ b), when n \geq b
Here, {\rm floor}(n / b) denotes the largest integer not exceeding n / b,
and n \ {\rm mod} \ b denotes the remainder of n divided by b.
Less formally, f(b,n) is equal to the sum of the digits of n written in base b.
For example, the following hold:
 - f(10,\,87654)=8+7+6+5+4=30
 - f(100,\,87654)=8+76+54=138
You are given integers n and s.
Determine if there exists an integer b (b \geq 2) such that f(b,n)=s.
If the answer is positive, also find the smallest such b.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq n \leq 10^{11}
 - 1 \leq s \leq 10^{11}
 - n,\,s are integers.

-----Input-----
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
n
s

-----Output-----
If there exists an integer b (b \geq 2) such that f(b,n)=s, print the smallest such b.
If such b does not exist, print -1 instead.

-----Sample Input-----
87654
30

-----Sample Output-----
10
