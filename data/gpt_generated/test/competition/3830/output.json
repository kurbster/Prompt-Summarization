The rooms are connected by $n$ conveyor belts, and the $i$-th conveyor belt connects the rooms $i$ and $(i+1) \\bmod n$. In the other words, rooms $0$ and $1$, $1$ and $2$, $\\ldots$, $n-2$ and $n-1$, $n-1$ and $0$ are connected with conveyor belts. The $i$-th conveyor belt is in one of three states:  If it is clockwise, snakes can only go from room $i$ to $(i+1) \\bmod n$.  If it is anticlockwise, snakes can only go from room $(i+1) \\bmod n$ to $i$.  If it is off, snakes can travel in either direction.  [Image]  Above is an example with $4$ rooms, where belts $0$ and $3$ are off, $1$ is clockwise, and $2$ is anticlockwise. Each snake wants to leave its room and come back to it later. A room is returnable if the snake there can leave the room, and later come back to it using the conveyor belts. How many such returnable rooms are there",
