In one of the games Arkady is fond of the game process happens on a rectangular field. In the game process Arkady can buy extensions for his field, each extension enlarges one of the field sizes in a particular number of times. Formally, there are n extensions, the i-th of them multiplies the width or the length (by Arkady's choice) by a_{i}. Each extension can't be used more than once, the extensions can be used in any order.

Now Arkady's field has size h × w. He wants to enlarge it so that it is possible to place a rectangle of size a × b on it (along the width or along the length, with sides parallel to the field sides). Find the minimum number of extensions needed to reach Arkady's goal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains five integers a, b, h, w and n (1 ≤ a, b, h, w, n ≤ 100 000) — the sizes of the rectangle needed to be placed, the initial sizes of the field and the number of available extensions.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (2 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100 000), where a_{i} equals the integer a side multiplies by when the i-th extension is applied.


-----Output-----

Print the minimum number of extensions needed to reach Arkady's goal. If it is not possible to place the rectangle on the field with all extensions, print -1. If the rectangle can be placed on the initial field, print 0.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 4 4
2 5 4 10

Output
1

Input
3 3 3 3 5
2 3 5 4 2

Output
0

Input
5 5 1 2 3
2 2 3

Output
-1

Input
3 4 1 1 3
2 3 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example it is enough to use any of the extensions available. For example, we can enlarge h in 5 times using the second extension. Then h becomes equal 10 and it is now possible to place the rectangle on the field.
