You are given an integer sequence A of length N and an integer K.
You will perform the following operation on this sequence Q times:
 - Choose a contiguous subsequence of length K, then remove the smallest element among the K elements contained in the chosen subsequence (if there are multiple such elements, choose one of them as you like).
Let X and Y be the values of the largest and smallest element removed in the Q operations. You would like X-Y to be as small as possible.
Find the smallest possible value of X-Y when the Q operations are performed optimally.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 2000
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - 1 \leq Q \leq N-K+1
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K Q
A_1 A_2 ... A_N

-----Output-----
Print the smallest possible value of X-Y.

-----Sample Input-----
5 3 2
4 3 1 5 2

-----Sample Output-----
1

In the first operation, whichever contiguous subsequence of length 3 we choose, the minimum element in it is 1.
Thus, the first operation removes A_3=1 and now we have A=(4,3,5,2).
In the second operation, it is optimal to choose (A_2,A_3,A_4)=(3,5,2) as the contiguous subsequence of length 3 and remove A_4=2.
In this case, the largest element removed is 2, and the smallest is 1, so their difference is 2-1=1.
