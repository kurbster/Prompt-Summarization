How many infinite sequences a_1, a_2, ... consisting of {{1, ... ,n}} satisfy the following conditions?
 - The n-th and subsequent elements are all equal. That is, if n \leq i,j, a_i = a_j.
 - For every integer i, the a_i elements immediately following the i-th element are all equal. That is, if i < j < k\leq i+a_i, a_j = a_k.
Find the count modulo 10^9+7.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq n \leq 10^6

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
n

-----Output-----
Print how many sequences satisfy the conditions, modulo 10^9+7.

-----Sample Input-----
2

-----Sample Output-----
4

The four sequences that satisfy the conditions are:
 - 1, 1, 1, ...
 - 1, 2, 2, ...
 - 2, 1, 1, ...
 - 2, 2, 2, ...
