One day, little Vasya found himself in a maze consisting of (n + 1) rooms, numbered from 1 to (n + 1). Initially, Vasya is at the first room and to get out of the maze, he needs to get to the (n + 1)-th one.

The maze is organized as follows. Each room of the maze has two one-way portals. Let's consider room number i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), someone can use the first portal to move from it to room number (i + 1), also someone can use the second portal to move from it to room number p_{i}, where 1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ i.

In order not to get lost, Vasya decided to act as follows.   Each time Vasya enters some room, he paints a cross on its ceiling. Initially, Vasya paints a cross at the ceiling of room 1.  Let's assume that Vasya is in room i and has already painted a cross on its ceiling. Then, if the ceiling now contains an odd number of crosses, Vasya uses the second portal (it leads to room p_{i}), otherwise Vasya uses the first portal. 

Help Vasya determine the number of times he needs to use portals to get to room (n + 1) in the end.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) — the number of rooms. The second line contains n integers p_{i} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ i). Each p_{i} denotes the number of the room, that someone can reach, if he will use the second portal in the i-th room.


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the number of portal moves the boy needs to go out of the maze. As the number can be rather large, print it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).
