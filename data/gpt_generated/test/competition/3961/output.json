Initially, Vasya is at the first room and to get out of the maze, he needs to get to the (n + 1)-th one. The maze is organized as follows. Each room of the maze has two one-way portals. Let's consider room number i (1   i  n), someone can use the first portal to move from it to room number (i + 1), also someone can use the second portal to move from it to room number p_{i}, where 1   p_{i}   i. In order not to get lost, Vasya decided to act as follows.   Each time Vasya enters some room, he paints a cross on its ceiling. Initially, Vasya paints a cross at the ceiling of room 1.  Let's assume that Vasya is in room i and has already painted a cross on its ceiling. Then, if the ceiling now contains an odd number of crosses, Vasya uses the second portal (it leads to room p_{i}), otherwise Vasya uses the first portal.  Help Vasya determine the number of times he needs to use portals to get to room (n + 1) in the end.",
