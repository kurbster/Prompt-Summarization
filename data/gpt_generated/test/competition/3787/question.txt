Determine if there exists a sequence obtained by permuting 1,2,...,N that satisfies the following conditions:
 - The length of its longest increasing subsequence is A.
 - The length of its longest decreasing subsequence is B.
If it exists, construct one such sequence.

-----Notes-----
A subsequence of a sequence P is a sequence that can be obtained by extracting some of the elements in P without changing the order.
A longest increasing subsequence of a sequence P is a sequence with the maximum length among the subsequences of P that are monotonically increasing.
Similarly, a longest decreasing subsequence of a sequence P is a sequence with the maximum length among the subsequences of P that are monotonically decreasing.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N,A,B \leq 3\times 10^5
 - All input values are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N A B

-----Output-----
If there are no sequences that satisfy the conditions, print -1.
Otherwise, print N integers. The i-th integer should be the i-th element of the sequence that you constructed.

-----Sample Input-----
5 3 2

-----Sample Output-----
2 4 1 5 3

One longest increasing subsequence of this sequence is {2,4,5}, and one longest decreasing subsequence of it is {4,3}.
