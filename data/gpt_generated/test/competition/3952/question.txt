There are $n$ points on the plane, the $i$-th of which is at $(x_i, y_i)$. Tokitsukaze wants to draw a strange rectangular area and pick all the points in the area.

The strange area is enclosed by three lines, $x = l$, $y = a$ and $x = r$, as its left side, its bottom side and its right side respectively, where $l$, $r$ and $a$ can be any real numbers satisfying that $l < r$. The upper side of the area is boundless, which you can regard as a line parallel to the $x$-axis at infinity. The following figure shows a strange rectangular area. [Image] 

A point $(x_i, y_i)$ is in the strange rectangular area if and only if $l < x_i < r$ and $y_i > a$. For example, in the above figure, $p_1$ is in the area while $p_2$ is not.

Tokitsukaze wants to know how many different non-empty sets she can obtain by picking all the points in a strange rectangular area, where we think two sets are different if there exists at least one point in one set of them but not in the other.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5$) — the number of points on the plane.

The $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $x_i$, $y_i$ ($1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9$) — the coordinates of the $i$-th point.

All points are distinct.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the number of different non-empty sets of points she can obtain.

-----Note-----

For the first example, there is exactly one set having $k$ points for $k = 1, 2, 3$, so the total number is $3$.

For the second example, the numbers of sets having $k$ points for $k = 1, 2, 3$ are $3$, $2$, $1$ respectively, and their sum is $6$.

For the third example, as the following figure shows, there are  $2$ sets having one point;  $3$ sets having two points;  $1$ set having four points. 

Therefore, the number of different non-empty sets in this example is $2 + 3 + 0 + 1 = 6$. [Image]
