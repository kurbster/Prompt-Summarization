The Painter and the three little hedgehogs now have to return to the Beaver s den where they will be safe from the water as quickly as possible! The map of the Enchanted Forest consists of R rows and C columns. Empty fields are represented by  .  characters, flooded fields by  *  and rocks by  X . Additionally, the Beaver s den is represented by  D and the Painter and the three little hedgehogs are shown as  S . Every minute the Painter and the three little hedgehogs can move to one of the four neighbouring fields (up, down, left or right). Every minute the flood expands as well so that all empty fields that have at least one common side with a flooded field become flooded as well. Neither water nor the Painter and the three little hedgehogs can pass through rocks. Naturally, the Painter and the three little hedgehogs cannot pass through flooded fields, and water cannot flood the Beaver s den. Write a program that will, given a map of the Enchanted Forest, output the shortest time needed for the Painter and the three little hedgehogs to safely reach the Beaver s den. ",
