Match sticks can be used to form digital numbers. The arrangement of matches that forms each digit between ‘0’ and ‘9’ is illustrated in the figure.

You are given two sequences of digits $X$ and $Y$. There are matches that have been arranged to form the digits in $X$. Can you move exactly one match from them, so that the resulting matches form the other sequence $Y$?

-----Input-----
The input contains one line with two sequences of digits $X$ and $Y$. It is guaranteed that $X$ and $Y$ have the same length but are different sequences. Each sequence contains digits between ‘0’ and ‘9’ and has at least one and no more than $12$ digits. A sequence may contain leading zeros.

-----Output-----
Output “yes” if it is possible to move exactly one match to change $X$ into $Y$. Otherwise output “no”.

-----Examples-----
Sample Input 1:
60 58
Sample Output 1:
yes

Sample Input 2:
046 040
Sample Output 2:
yes
