Given the root of a tree, you are asked to find the most frequent subtree sum. The subtree sum of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself). So what is the most frequent subtree sum value  If there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency in any order. 
tl;dr: You are given root of a tree. Find the most frequent subtree sum value if the  subtree sum of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself). If there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency. 

It's Friday night, and Chuck is bored. He's already run 1,000 miles, stopping only to eat a family sized bag of Heatwave Doritos and a large fistful of M&Ms. He just can't stop thinking about kicking something!  There is only one thing for it, Chuck heads down to his local MMA gym and immediately challenges every fighter there to get in the cage and try and take him down... AT THE SAME TIME!  You are provided an array of strings that represent the cage and Chuck's opponents. Your task, in traditional Chuck style, is to take their heads off!! Throw punches, kicks, headbutts (or more likely - regex or iteration...) but whatever you do, remove their heads. Return the same array of strings, but with the heads ('O') removed and replaced with a space (' '). If the provided array is empty, or is an empty string, return 'Gym is empty'. If you are given an array of numbers, return 'This isn't the gym!!'. FIGHT!! *Original design of this kata was a much more beautiful thing - the test cases illustrate the idea, and the intended output. I am unable to make the actual output go over multiple lines so for now at least you will have to imagine the beauty!

Kate likes to count words in text blocks. By words she means continuous sequences of English alphabetic characters (from a to z ). Here are examples: `Hello there, little user5453 374 ())$. I d been using my sphere as a stool. Slow-moving target 839342 was hit by OMGd-63 or K4mp.` contains "words" `['Hello', 'there', 'little', 'user', 'I', 'd', 'been', 'using', 'my','sphere', 'as', 'a', 'stool', 'Slow', 'moving', 'target', 'was', 'hit', 'by', 'OMGd', 'or', 'K', 'mp']` Kate doesn't like some of words and doesn't count them. Words to be excluded are "a", "the", "on", "at", "of", "upon", "in" and "as", case-insensitive. Today Kate's too lazy and have decided to teach her computer to count "words" for her.

You are the boss of ACM (Association for Control over Minds), an upstanding company with a single goal of world domination. Yesterday, you woke up, and saw that the weather was clear, and the birds were singing.  Another day, another world domination plan , you sang to yourself as you devised your next world domination plan involving the illusory mind control potions. There s only one insignificant problem you have to solve before you can execute this perfection of a plan: you don t know the correct recipe for the mind control potion. You asked the local Panda-breed brewmaster for the recipe, but unfortunately he didn t know either. Instead, he gave you the mysterious tome titled The Root of all Evil (written by Halim the White). You read the evil book under candle light, and wrote down all the potion recipes contained inside the book.  One of them must be the formula for the mind control potion, I m sure of it! , you said to yourself. You numbered these recipes from $1$ through $N$.  I just need to try concocting all of these recipes! , you hummed to yourself. Today, you woke up, and saw that the weather was clear, and , anyway. You have purchased all the utensils and ingredients from the local grocery   onion, carrot, broom, vials, cauldrons, bat wings,  , all common grocery items. Now, you are ready to begin your experiments, but then you notice that some of the recipes share common ingredients! Unfortunately, you only bought one of each ingredient with you.  Oh no! What should I do now ! , you panicked.  I ll just create some of the potions today, and do the remaining ones later. , you resolved. You consider all your recipes one by one in order by their number from recipe $1$ through recipe $N$. For each recipe, if you are not able to concoct this potion (explained in the next paragraph), you skip this recipe, and consider the next one, if any. Otherwise, even though it may cause some of the next potions to no longer be concoctable, you concoct this recipe. Thus, whether to concoct a potion is not a choice. It s simply determined by whether it is possible or not to do so when you consider the potion. In order to concoct a potion, you first prepare a new empty cauldron (you managed to procure an infinite number of cauldrons from the grocery store). Then, you combine all of the ingredients required for this potion and nothing else in this cauldron (that is, the cauldron cannot contain any ingredients not listed in the recipe). For the ingredients that have not been used for any of the previous potions that you ve decided to concoct, you can simply put it into this cauldron. You can also pour the entire content of the cauldron used for one of your previous concoctions into this cauldron, thus mixing in all of the ingredients contained inside the cauldron (since you pour all of the content of the cauldron, this previous concoction can no longer be used for any of your next concoctions). Finally, you stir this cauldron with your broom and take a vial of the concoction to test on your minions later. The remaining concoction remains in this cauldron, and can be poured into another cauldron later.  What is the number of recipes you will concoct this way today  , you asked yourself. 
tl;dr:
