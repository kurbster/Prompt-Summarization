Lea runs into a lot of words in her life. A lot of them she finds unpleasant. To compensate for that she started making up pleasant words. Lea makes up new words by writing a nice looking string of characters on a piece of paper. She than erases a few of the most nasty looking characters and replaces them with underscores ‘_’. After that she tries to replace the underscores with more acceptable characters trying to form a pleasant word.

Lea considers words pleasant if they do not contain $3$ sequential vowels, $3$ sequential consonants and contain at least one letter ‘L’.

In Croatian, the vowels are the letters A, E, I, O, and U only. All other lettters are consonants.
