You are given an unweighted, undirected graph. Write a program to check if it's a tree topology.

-----Input-----

The first line of the input file contains two integers N and M --- number of nodes and number of edges in the graph (0 < N <= 10000, 0 <= M <= 20000). Next M lines contain M edges of that graph --- Each line contains a pair (u, v) means there is an edge between node u and node v (1 <= u,v <= N).

-----Output-----

Print YES if the given graph is a tree, otherwise print NO.

-----Example-----
Input:
3 2
1 2
2 3

Output:
YES
