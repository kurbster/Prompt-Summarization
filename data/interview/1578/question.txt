Given an alphanumeric string made up of digits and lower case Latin characters only, find the sum of all the digit characters in the string.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
- Each test case is described with a single line containing a string S, the alphanumeric string.

-----Output-----
- For each test case, output a single line containing the sum of all the digit characters in that string.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 1000, where |S| is the length of the string S.

-----Example-----
Input:
1
ab1231da

Output:
7

-----Explanation-----
The digits in this string are 1, 2, 3 and 1. Hence, the sum of all of them is 7.
