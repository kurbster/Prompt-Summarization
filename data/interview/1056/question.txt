Write a program to check whether a triangle is valid or not, when the three angles of the triangle are the inputs. A triangle is valid if the sum of all the three angles is equal to 180 degrees.

-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer T, the total number of testcases. Then T lines follow, each line contains three angles  A, B and C, of the triangle separated by space. 

-----Output-----
For each test case, display 'YES' if the triangle is valid, and 'NO', if it is not, in a new line.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ A,B,C ≤ 180

-----Example-----
Input

3 
40 40 100
45 45 90
180 1 1
Output

YES
YES
NO
