**This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students**

All Star Code Challenge #16

Create a function called noRepeat() that takes a string argument and returns a single letter string of the **first** not repeated character in the entire string.

``` haskell
noRepeat "aabbccdde" `shouldBe` 'e'
noRepeat "wxyz"      `shouldBe` 'w'
noRepeat "testing"   `shouldBe` 'e'
```

Note:
ONLY letters from the english alphabet will be used as input
There will ALWAYS be at least one non-repeating letter in the input string
