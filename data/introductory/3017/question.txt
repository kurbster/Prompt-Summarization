# Task
 Vanya gets bored one day and decides to enumerate a large pile of rocks. He first counts the rocks and finds out that he has `n` rocks in the pile, then he goes to the store to buy labels for enumeration. 
 
 Each of the labels is a digit from 0 to 9 and each of the `n` rocks should be assigned a unique number from `1` to `n`.

 If each label costs `$1`, how much money will Vanya spend on this project?

# Input/Output


 - `[input]` integer `n`

  The number of rocks in the pile.

  `1  ≤  n  ≤  10^9`


 - `[output]` an integer

  the cost of the enumeration.
  
# Example

 For `n = 13`, the result should be `17`.
 ```
 the numbers from 1 to n are:
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
 we need 17 single digit labels:
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3
 each label cost $1, so the output should be 17.
