A cake is sliced with n straight lines. Your task is to calculate the maximum number of pieces the cake can have. # Example For `n = 0`, the output should be `1`. For `n = 1`, the output should be `2`. For `n = 2`, the output should be `4`. For `n = 3`, the output should be `7`. # Input/Output - `[input]` integer `n` `0 ≤ n ≤ 10000` - `[output]` an integer The maximum number of pieces the sliced cake can have.
