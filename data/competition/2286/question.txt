In Finite Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (FEIS), all integer sequences of lengths between 1 and N (inclusive) consisting of integers between 1 and K (inclusive) are listed.
Let the total number of sequences listed in FEIS be X. Among those sequences, find the (X/2)-th (rounded up to the nearest integer) lexicographically smallest one.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N,K \leq 3 × 10^5
 - N and K are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
K N

-----Output-----
Print the (X/2)-th (rounded up to the nearest integer) lexicographically smallest sequence listed in FEIS, with spaces in between, where X is the total number of sequences listed in FEIS.

-----Sample Input-----
3 2

-----Sample Output-----
2 1 

There are 12 sequences listed in FEIS: (1),(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3).
The (12/2 = 6)-th lexicographically smallest one among them is (2,1).
