Recently, Pari and Arya did some research about NP-Hard problems and they found the minimum vertex cover problem very interesting.

Suppose the graph G is given. Subset A of its vertices is called a vertex cover of this graph, if for each edge uv there is at least one endpoint of it in this set, i.e. $u \in A$ or $v \in A$ (or both).

Pari and Arya have won a great undirected graph as an award in a team contest. Now they have to split it in two parts, but both of them want their parts of the graph to be a vertex cover.

They have agreed to give you their graph and you need to find two disjoint subsets of its vertices A and B, such that both A and B are vertex cover or claim it's impossible. Each vertex should be given to no more than one of the friends (or you can even keep it for yourself).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the number of vertices and the number of edges in the prize graph, respectively.

Each of the next m lines contains a pair of integers u_{i} and v_{i} (1  ≤  u_{i},  v_{i}  ≤  n), denoting an undirected edge between u_{i} and v_{i}. It's guaranteed the graph won't contain any self-loops or multiple edges.


-----Output-----

If it's impossible to split the graph between Pari and Arya as they expect, print "-1" (without quotes).

If there are two disjoint sets of vertices, such that both sets are vertex cover, print their descriptions. Each description must contain two lines. The first line contains a single integer k denoting the number of vertices in that vertex cover, and the second line contains k integers — the indices of vertices. Note that because of m ≥ 1, vertex cover cannot be empty.


-----Examples-----

Output

-----Note-----

In the first sample, you can give the vertex number 2 to Arya and vertices numbered 1 and 3 to Pari and keep vertex number 4 for yourself (or give it someone, if you wish).

In the second sample, there is no way to satisfy both Pari and Arya.
