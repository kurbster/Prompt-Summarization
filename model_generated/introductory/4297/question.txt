Write a function getMean that takes as parameters an array (arr) and 2 integers (x and y). The function should return the mean between the mean of the the first x elements of the array and the mean of the last y elements of the array.

The mean should be computed if both x and y have values higher than 1 but less or equal to the array's length. Otherwise the function should return -1.

getMean([1,3,2,4], 2, 3) should return 2.5 because: the mean of the the first 2 elements of the array is (1+3)/2=2 and the mean of the last 3 elements of the array is (4+2+3)/3=3 so the mean of those 2 means is (2+3)/2=2.5.

getMean([1,3,2,4], 1, 2) should return -1 because x is not higher than 1.

getMean([1,3,2,4], 2, 8) should return -1 because 8 is higher than the array's length.
