=====Function Descriptions=====
So far, we have only heard of Python's powers. Now, we will witness them!

Powers or exponents in Python can be calculated using the built-in power function. Call the power function a^b as shown below:
>>> pow(a,b) 

or

>>> a**b

It's also possible to calculate a^b mod m.
>>> pow(a,b,m)  

This is very helpful in computations where you have to print the resultant % mod.

Note: Here, a and b can be floats or negatives, but, if a third argument is present, b cannot be negative.

Note: Python has a math module that has its own pow(). It takes two arguments and returns a float. Frankly speaking, we will never use math.pow().

=====Problem Statement=====
You are given three integers: a, b, and m, respectively. Print two lines.
The first line should print the result of pow(a,b). The second line should print the result of pow(a,b,m).

=====Input Format=====
The first line contains a, the second line contains b, and the third line contains m.

=====Constraints=====
1≤a≤10
1≤b≤10
2≤m≤1000
