*This is my first Kata in the Ciphers series. This series is meant to test our coding knowledge.*

## Ciphers #1 - The 01 Cipher
This cipher doesn't exist, I just created it by myself. It can't actually be used, as there isn't a way to decode it. It's a hash. Multiple sentences may also have the same result.

## How this cipher works
It looks at the letter, and sees it's index in the alphabet, the alphabet being `a-z`, if you didn't know. If it is odd, it is replaced with `1`, if it's even, its replaced with `0`. Note that the index should start from 0. Also, if the character isn't a letter, it remains the same.

## Example

This is because `H`'s index is `7`, which is odd, so it is replaced by `1`, and so on.

Have fun (en)coding!
