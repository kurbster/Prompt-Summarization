This problem is actually a subproblem of problem G from the same contest.

There are $n$ candies in a candy box. The type of the $i$-th candy is $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$).

You have to prepare a gift using some of these candies with the following restriction: the numbers of candies of each type presented in a gift should be all distinct (i. e. for example, a gift having two candies of type $1$ and two candies of type $2$ is bad). 

It is possible that multiple types of candies are completely absent from the gift. It is also possible that not all candies of some types will be taken to a gift.

Your task is to find out the maximum possible size of the single gift you can prepare using the candies you have.

You have to answer $q$ independent queries.

If you are Python programmer, consider using PyPy instead of Python when you submit your code.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of queries. Each query is represented by two lines.

The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of candies.

The second line of each query contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$), where $a_i$ is the type of the $i$-th candy in the box.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all queries does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each query print one integer — the maximum possible size of the single gift you can compose using candies you got in this query with the restriction described in the problem statement.


-----Example-----
Input
3
8
1 4 8 4 5 6 3 8
16
2 1 3 3 4 3 4 4 1 3 2 2 2 4 1 1
9
2 2 4 4 4 7 7 7 7

Output
3
10
9



-----Note-----

In the first query, you can prepare a gift with two candies of type $8$ and one candy of type $5$, totalling to $3$ candies.

Note that this is not the only possible solution — taking two candies of type $4$ and one candy of type $6$ is also valid.
