# Task
 You are given an array of integers `arr` that representing coordinates of obstacles situated on a straight line.

 Assume that you are jumping from the point with coordinate 0 to the right. You are allowed only to make jumps of the same length represented by some integer.

 Find the minimal length of the jump enough to avoid all the obstacles.

# Example

 For `arr = [5, 3, 6, 7, 9]`, the output should be `4`.

# Input/Output


 - `[input]` integer array `arr`

    Non-empty array of positive integers.

    Constraints: `1 ≤ inputArray[i] ≤ 100.`


 - `[output]` an integer

    The desired length.
