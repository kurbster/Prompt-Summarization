You have a grid with `$m$` rows and `$n$` columns. Return the number of unique ways that start from the top-left corner and go to the bottom-right corner. You are only allowed to move right and down.

For example, in the below grid of `$2$` rows and `$3$` columns, there are `$10$` unique paths:

```
o----o----o----o
|    |    |    |
o----o----o----o
|    |    |    |
o----o----o----o
```

**Note:** there are random tests for grids up to 1000 x 1000 in most languages, so a naive solution will not work.
