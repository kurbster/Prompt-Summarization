Lexicographic permutations are ordered combinations of a set of items ordered in a specific way.

For instance, the first 8 permutations of the digits 0123, in lexicographic order, are:

```
1st 0123
2nd 0132
3rd 0213
4th 0231
5th 0312
6th 0321
7th 1023
8th 1032
```

Your task is to write a function ```L( n, d )``` that will return a `string` representing the `nth` permutation of the `d` digit, starting with 0 (i.e. d=10 means all digits 0123456789).

So for `d = 4`, `L(7,4)` should return `'1023'`, and `L(4,4)` should return `'0231'`
.


Some things to bear in mind:

• The function should return a `string`, otherwise permutations beginning with a 0 will have it removed. 

• Test cases will not exceed the highest possible valid values for `n`

• The function should work for any `d` between `1` and `10`.

• A value of 1 for `n` means the 1st permutation, so `n = 0` is not a valid input.

• Oh, and no itertools ;)
