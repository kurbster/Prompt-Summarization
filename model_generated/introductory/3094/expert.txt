 Sum all the numbers of the array (in F# and Haskell you get a list) except the highest and the lowest element (the value, not the index!). (The highest/lowest element is respectively only one element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value!) Example: ``` { 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 } => 16 { 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 } => 6 ``` If array is empty, null or None
