Implement a function which behaves like the uniq command in UNIX.

It takes as input a sequence and returns a sequence in which all duplicate elements following each other have been reduced to one instance.

Example:

```
["a", "a", "b", "b", "c", "a", "b", "c"]  =>  ["a", "b", "c", "a", "b", "c"]
```
