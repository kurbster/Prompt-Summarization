 You are given an array nums of non-negative integers. nums is considered special if there exists a number x such that there are exactly x numbers in nums that are greater than or equal to x. Notice that x does not have to be an element in nums. Return x if the array is special, otherwise, return -1. It can be proven that if nums is special, the value for x is unique.   Example 1: Input: nums = [3,5] Output: 2 Explanation: There are 2 values (3 and 5) that are greater than or equal to 2. Example 2
