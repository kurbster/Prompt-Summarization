In your class, you have started lessons about geometric progression.
Since you are also a programmer, you have decided to write a function that will print first `n` elements of the sequence with the given constant `r` and first element `a`.

Result should be separated by comma and space.

### Example

```python
geometric_sequence_elements(2, 3, 5) == '2, 6, 18, 54, 162'
```
