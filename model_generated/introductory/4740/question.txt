Given the triangle of consecutive odd numbers:

```
             1
          3     5
       7     9    11
   13    15    17    19
21    23    25    27    29
...
```

Calculate the row sums of this triangle from the row index (starting at index 1) e.g.:

```python
row_sum_odd_numbers(1); # 1
row_sum_odd_numbers(2); # 3 + 5 = 8
```

```if:nasm
row_sum_odd_numbers:
