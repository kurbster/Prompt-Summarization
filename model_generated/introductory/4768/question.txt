A company is opening a bank, but the coder who is designing the user class made some errors. They need  you  to help them. 

You must include the following:

- A withdraw method
  - Subtracts money from balance
  - One parameter, money to withdraw
  - Raise ValueError if there isn't enough money to withdraw
  - Return a string with name and balence(see examples)
  
* A check method
  - Adds money to baleance
  - Two parameters, other user and money
  - Other user will always be valid
  - Raise a ValueError if other user doesn't have enough money
  - Raise a ValueError if checking_account isn't true for other user
  - Return a string with name and balance plus other name and other balance(see examples)
  
- An add_cash method
  - Adds money to balance
  - One parameter, money to add
  - Return a string with name and balance(see examples)

Additional Notes:
  * Checking_account should be stored as a boolean
  - No input numbers will be negitive
  * Output must end with period
  - Float numbers will not be used so, balance should be integer
  * No currency will be used
  
Examples:
``` Python
Jeff = User('Jeff', 70, True)
Joe = User('Joe', 70, False)

Jeff.withdraw(2) # Returns 'Jeff has 68.'

Joe.check(Jeff, 50) # Returns 'Joe has 120 and Jeff has 18.'

Jeff.check(Joe, 80) # Raises a ValueError

Joe.checking_account = True # Enables checking for Joe

Jeff.check(Joe, 80) # Returns 'Jeff has 98 and Joe has 40'

Joe.check(Jeff, 100) # Raises a ValueError

Jeff.add_cash(20.00) # Returns 'Jeff has 118.'
```

 Good Luck
