Write a function that takes an integer in input and outputs a string with currency format.

Integer in currency format is expressed by a string of number where every three characters are separated by comma. 

For example:

```
123456 --> "123,456"
```

Input will always be an positive integer, so don't worry about type checking or negative/float values.
