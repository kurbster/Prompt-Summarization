We need a function ```prime_bef_aft()``` that gives the largest prime below a certain given value ```n```, 

```befPrime or bef_prime``` (depending on the language), 

and the smallest prime larger than this value, 

```aftPrime/aft_prime``` (depending on the language).

The result should be output in a list like the following:

```python
prime_bef_aft(n) == [befPrime, aftPrime]
```

If n is a prime number it will give two primes, n will not be included in the result.

Let's see some cases:
```python
prime_bef_aft(100) == [97, 101]

prime_bef_aft(97) == [89, 101]

prime_bef_aft(101) == [97, 103]
```
Range for the random tests: 
```1000 <= n <= 200000```

(The extreme and special case n = 2 will not be considered for the tests. Thanks Blind4Basics)

Happy coding!!
