In this Kata, you will be given a string and your task will be to return a list of ints detailing the count of uppercase letters, lowercase, numbers and special characters, as follows.

```Haskell
Solve("*'&ABCDabcde12345") = [4,5,5,3]. 
--the order is: uppercase letters, lowercase, numbers and special characters.
```

More examples in the test cases. 

Good luck!
