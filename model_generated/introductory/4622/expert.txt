 Your job is to build a function which determines whether or not there are double characters in a string (including whitespace characters). For example ```aa```, ``!!`` or ```  ```.   You want the function to return true if the string contains double characters and false if not.  The test should not be case sensitive; for example both ```aa``` & ```aA``` return true. Examples: ```python   double_check("abca")   #returns False      double_check("aabc")
