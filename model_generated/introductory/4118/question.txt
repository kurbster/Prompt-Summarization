The characters of Chima need your help. Their weapons got mixed up! They need you to write a program that accepts the name of a character in Chima then tells which weapon he/she owns.

For example: for the character `"Laval"` your program should return the solution `"Laval-Shado Valious"`

You must complete the following character-weapon pairs:

* Laval-Shado Valious, 
* Cragger-Vengdualize, 
* Lagravis-Blazeprowlor, 
* Crominus-Grandorius, 
* Tormak-Tygafyre, 
* LiElla-Roarburn. 
    
Return `"Not a character"` for invalid inputs.
