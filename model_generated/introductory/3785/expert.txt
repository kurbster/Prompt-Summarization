 Return an array containing the first `l` digits from the `n`th diagonal of the triangle.   n = 0 should generate the first diagonal of the triangle (the 'ones'). The first number in each diagonal should be 1. If `l = 0`, return an empty array. Assume that both `n` and `l` will be non-negative integers in all test cases.
