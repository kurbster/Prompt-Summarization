Array inversion indicates how far the array is from being sorted.

Inversions are pairs of elements in array that are out of order.

## Examples

```
[1, 2, 3, 4]  =>  0 inversions
[1, 3, 2, 4]  =>  1 inversion: 2 and 3
[4, 1, 2, 3]  =>  3 inversions: 4 and 1, 4 and 2, 4 and 3
[4, 3, 2, 1]  =>  6 inversions: 4 and 3, 4 and 2, 4 and 1, 3 and 2, 3 and 1, 2 and 1
```

## Goal

The goal is to come up with a function that can calculate inversions for any arbitrary array
