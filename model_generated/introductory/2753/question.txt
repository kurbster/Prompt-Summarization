KISS stands for Keep It Simple Stupid.
It is a design principle for keeping things simple rather than complex.

You are the boss of Joe.

Joe is submitting words to you to publish to a blog. He likes to complicate things.

Define a function that determines if Joe's work is simple or complex.

Input will be non emtpy strings with no punctuation.

It is simple if:
``` the length of each word does not exceed the amount of words in the string ```
(See example test cases)

Otherwise it is complex.

If complex:
```python
return "Keep It Simple Stupid"
```
or if it was kept simple:
```python
return "Good work Joe!"
```

Note: Random test are random and nonsensical. Here is a silly example of a random test:
```python
"jump always mostly is touchy dancing choice is pineapples mostly"
```
