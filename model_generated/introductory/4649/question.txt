Your website is divided vertically in sections, and each can be of different size (height).  
You need to establish the section index (starting at `0`) you are at, given the `scrollY` and `sizes` of all sections.  
Sections start with `0`, so if first section is `200` high, it takes `0-199` "pixels" and second starts at `200`.

### Example:

`getSectionIdFromScroll( 300, [300,200,400,600,100] )`

will output number `1` as it's the second section.

`getSectionIdFromScroll( 1600, [300,200,400,600,100] )`

will output number `-1` as it's past last section.

Given the `scrollY` integer (always non-negative) and an array of non-negative integers (with at least one element), calculate the index (starting at `0`) or `-1` if `scrollY` falls beyond last section (indication of an error).
