=====Function Descriptions=====
Exceptions
Errors detected during execution are called exceptions.

Examples:
ZeroDivisionError
This error is raised when the second argument of a division or modulo operation is zero.
>>> a = '1'
>>> b = '0'
>>> print int(a) / int(b)
>>> ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero

ValueError
This error is raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value.
>>> a = '1'
>>> b = '#'
>>> print int(a) / int(b)
>>> ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '#'

Handling Exceptions
The statements try and except can be used to handle selected exceptions. A try statement may have more than one except clause to specify handlers for different exceptions.

#Code
try:
    print 1/0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print "Error Code:",e
Output

Error Code: integer division or modulo by zero

=====Problem Statement=====
You are given two values a and b.
Perform integer division and print a/b.

=====Input Format=====
The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
The next T lines each contain the space separated values of a and b.

=====Constraints=====
0<T<10

=====Output Format=====
Print the value of a/b.
In the case of ZeroDivisionError or ValueError, print the error code.
