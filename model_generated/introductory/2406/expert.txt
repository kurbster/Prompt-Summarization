 let's call an array arr a mountain if the following properties hold: arr.length >= 3 There exists some i with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:          arr[0] < arr[1] < ... arr[i-1] < arr[i]  arr[i] > arr[i+1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1] Given an integer array arr that is guaranteed to be a mountain, return any i such that arr[0] < arr[1] < ...
