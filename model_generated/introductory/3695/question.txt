# Task
 You are given a string `s`. Let's call its substring a group, if all letters in it are adjacent and the same(such as `"aa","bbb","cccc"`..). Let's call the substiring with 2 or more adjacent group a big group(such as `"aabb","bbccc"`...).
 
 Your task is to count the number of `big groups` in the given string.

# Example

 For `s = "ccccoodeffffiiighhhhhhhhhhttttttts"`, the result should be `3`.
 ```
The groups are "cccc", "oo", "ffff", "iii", "hhhhhhhhhh", "ttttttt"
The big groups are "ccccoo", "ffffiii", "hhhhhhhhhhttttttt", 
3 substrings altogether.```

 For `s = "gztxxxxxggggggggggggsssssssbbbbbeeeeeeehhhmmmmmmmitttttttlllllhkppppp"`, the result should be `2`.
 ```
The big groups are :
"xxxxxggggggggggggsssssssbbbbbeeeeeeehhhmmmmmmm"
and 
"tttttttlllll" ```

 For `s = "soooooldieeeeeer"`, the result should be `0`.
 
 There is no `big group` exist.
