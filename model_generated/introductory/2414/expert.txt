 Given an array of integers arr, and three integers a, b and c. You need to find the number of good triplets. A triplet (arr[i], arr[j], arr[k]) is good if the following conditions are true: 0 <= i < j < k < arr.length |arr[i] - arr[j]| <= a |arr[j] - arr[k]| <= b |arr[i] - arr[k]| <= c Where |x| denotes the absolute value of x. Return the number of good triplets.   Example 1: Input: arr = [
