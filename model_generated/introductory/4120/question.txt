Python dictionaries are inherently unsorted. So what do you do if you need to sort the contents of a dictionary?

Create a function that returns a sorted list of `(key, value)` tuples (Javascript: arrays of 2 items).

The list must be sorted by the `value` and be sorted **largest to smallest**.

## Examples

```python
sort_dict({3:1, 2:2, 1:3}) == [(1,3), (2,2), (3,1)]
sort_dict({1:2, 2:4, 3:6}) == [(3,6), (2,4), (1,2)]
```
