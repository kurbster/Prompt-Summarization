 Given a list of dominoes, dominoes[i] = [a, b] is equivalent to dominoes[j] = [c, d] if and only if either (a==c and b==d), or (a==d and b==c) - that is, one domino can be rotated to be equal to another domino. Return the number of pairs (i, j) for which 0 <= i < j < dominoes.length, and dominoes[i] is equivalent to dominoes[j].
