##Task:
You have to write a function `add` which takes two binary numbers as strings and returns their sum as a string.

##Note:
* You are `not allowed to convert binary to decimal & vice versa`.
* The sum should contain `No leading zeroes`.

##Examples:
```
add('111','10'); => '1001'
add('1101','101'); => '10010'
add('1101','10111') => '100100'
```
