We define the function `f1(n,k)`, as the least multiple of `n` that has all its digits less than `k`. 

We define the function `f2(n,k)`, as the least multiple of `n` that has all the digits that are less than `k`.

Each digit may occur more than once in both values of `f1(n,k)` and `f2(n,k)`.

The possible values for `n` and `k` according to these ranges for both functions `f1` and `f2` in this kata:
``` 
1 <= n <= 1.000.000.000.000
3 <= k <= 9
``` 

For example, let's see the value of both functions for `n = 71` and `k = 4`:
``` 
f1(71,4) == 213 # all its digits less than 4
f2(71,4) == 2130 # 0,1,2,3 all of them present 
```
The integer `76` is the first integer that has the same values of `f1` and `f2` for `k = 4`. 
```
f1(76,4) = f2(76,4) = 10032
```
Let's call these kind of numbers, **forgiving numbers**. (Let's continue with the fashion of attributing personality traits to numbers and, of course, an unknown one)
So, `76` is the smallest forgiving number of order `4`.
In the same way, `485` is the smallest forgiving number of order `5`.

Create a function that given an integer `n` and the order `k`, will output the higher and closest forgiving number to `n` of order `k`.

Let's see some examples:
```
find_f1_eq_f2(500,5) == 547
find_f1_eq_f2(1600,6) == 1799
find_f1_eq_f2(14900,7) == 14996
```
If the number `n` is a forgiving itself for a certain order `k`, the function will never output the same value, remember, closest and **higher** than `n`.

For example, `3456`, is a forgiving one of order `4`,
```
find_f1_eq_f2(3456,4) == 3462
```
**Features of the tests:**

* `n` and `k` will be always valid and positive integers.

* A total of 8 fixed tests.

* A total of 150 random tests in the ranges for `n` and `k` given above.

I'll be waiting your awesome solution. :)
