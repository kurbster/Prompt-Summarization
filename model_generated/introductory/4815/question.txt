Description:

#Task:

Write a function that returns true if the number is a "Very Even" number.

If a number is a single digit, then it is simply "Very Even" if it itself is even.

If it has 2 or more digits, it is "Very Even" if the sum of it's digits is "Very Even".


#Examples:
```
input(88) => returns false -> 8 + 8 = 16 -> 1 + 6 = 7 => 7 is odd 

input(222) => returns true

input(5) => returns false

input(841) => returns true -> 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 -> 1 + 3 => 4 is even
```

Note: The numbers will always be 0 or positive integers!
