=====Problem Statement=====
You are given a positive integer N.
Your task is to print a palindromic triangle of size N.

For example, a palindromic triangle of size 5 is:
1
121
12321
1234321
123454321

You can't take more than two lines. The first line (a for-statement) is already written for you.
You have to complete the code using exactly one print statement.

Note:
Using anything related to strings will give a score of 0.
Using more than one for-statement will give a score of 0.

=====Input Format=====
A single line of input containing the integer N.

=====Constraints=====
0<N<10

=====Output Format=====
Print the palindromic triangle of size N as explained above.
