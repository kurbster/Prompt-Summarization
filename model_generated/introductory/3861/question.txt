# The President's phone is broken

He is not very happy.

The only letters still working are uppercase ```E```, ```F```, ```I```, ```R```, ```U```, ```Y```.

An angry tweet is sent to the department responsible for presidential phone maintenance.


# Kata Task

Decipher the tweet by looking for words with known meanings.


* ```FIRE``` = *"You are fired!"*
* ```FURY``` = *"I am furious."*

If no known words are found, or unexpected letters are encountered, then it must be a *"Fake tweet."*

# Notes

* The tweet reads left-to-right.
* Any letters not spelling words ```FIRE``` or ```FURY``` are just ignored
* If multiple of the same words are found in a row then plural rules apply -
 * ```FIRE``` x 1 = *"You are fired!"*
 * ```FIRE``` x 2 = *"You and you are fired!"*
 * ```FIRE``` x 3 = *"You and you and you are fired!"*
 * etc...
 * ```FURY``` x 1 = *"I am furious."*
 * ```FURY``` x 2 = *"I am really furious."*
 * ```FURY``` x 3 = *"I am really really furious."*
 * etc...

# Examples

* ex1. FURYYYFIREYYFIRE = *"I am furious. You and you are fired!"*
* ex2. FIREYYFURYYFURYYFURRYFIRE = *"You are fired! I am really furious. You are fired!"*
* ex3. FYRYFIRUFIRUFURE = *"Fake tweet."*
