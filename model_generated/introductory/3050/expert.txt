 Write a function called `LCS` that accepts two sequences and returns the longest subsequence common to the passed in sequences. ### Subsequence A subsequence is different from a substring. The terms of a subsequence need not be consecutive terms of the original sequence. ### Example subsequence Subsequences of `"abc"` = `"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"`, `"ab"`, `"ac"`, `"bc"` and `"abc"`. ### LCS examples ```python lcs( "abcdef
