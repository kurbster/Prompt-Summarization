 You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers. You have to find the length of the shortest prefix of elements you need to erase from $a$ to make it a good array. Recall that the prefix of the array $a=[a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n]$ is a subarray consisting several first elements: the prefix of the array $a$ of length $k$ is the array $[a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k]$ ($0 \le k \le n$). The array $b
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow. The first line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the length of $a$. The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$ ($\sum n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$). -----Output----- For each test case, print the answer: the length of the shortest prefix of elements you need to erase from $a$ to make it a good array. -----Example----- Input 5 4 1 2 3 4 7 4 3 3 8 4 5 2 3 1 1 1 7 1 3 1 4 5 3 2 5 5 4 3 2 3 Output 0 4 0 2 3 -----Note----- In the first test case of the example, the array $a$ is already good, so we don't need to erase any prefix. In the second test case of the example, the initial array $a$ is not good. Let's erase first $4$ elements of $a$, the result is $[4, 5, 2]$. The resulting array is good. You can prove that if you erase fewer number of first elements, the result will not be good.
