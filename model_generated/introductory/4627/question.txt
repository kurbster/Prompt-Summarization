Simply find the closest value to zero from the list. Notice that there are negatives in the list.

List is always not empty and contains only integers. Return ```None``` if it is not possible to define only one of such values. And of course, we are expecting 0 as closest value to zero.

Examples:
```code
[2, 4, -1, -3]  => -1
[5, 2, -2]      => None
[5, 2, 2]       => 2
[13, 0, -6]     => 0
```
