We are interested in collecting the triples of positive integers ```(a, b, c)``` that fulfill the following equation:
```python
a² + b² = c³
```
The first triple with the lowest values that satisfies the equation we have above is (2, 2 ,2).
In effect:
```python
2² + 2² = 2³
4  + 4  = 8
```
The first pair of triples that "shares" the same value of ```c``` is: ```(2, 11, 5)``` and ```(5, 10, 5)```. 

Both triples share the same value of ```c```  is ```c = 5```. 
```python
Triple (2, 11, 5)                  Triple(5, 10, 5)
2² + 11² =  5³                      5² +  10²  =  5³
4  + 121 = 125                     25  + 100   = 125
```
So, we say that the value ```c``` has two solutions because there are two triples sharing the same value of ```c```.

There are some values of ```c``` with no solutions.

The first value of ```c``` that have a surprising number of solutions is ```65``` with ```8``` different triples.

In order to avoid duplications you will consider that ```a <= b``` always.

Make the function ```find_abc_sumsqcube()```, that may give us the values of c for an specific number of solutions.

For that purpose the above required function will receive two arguments, ```c_max``` and ```num_sol```. It is understandable that ```c_max``` will give to our function the upper limit of ```c``` and ```num_sol```, the specific number of solutions.

The function will output a sorted list with the values of ```c``` that have a number of solutions equals to ```num_sol```

Let's see some cases: 
```python
find_abc_sumsqcube(5, 1) == [2] # below or equal to c_max = 5 we have triple the (2, 2, 2) (see above)

find_abc_sumsqcube(5, 2) == [5] # now we want the values of ```c ≤ c_max``` with two solutions (see above again)

find_abc_sumsqcube(10, 2) == [5, 10]

find_abc_sumsqcube(20, 8) == [] # There are no values of c equal and bellow 20 having 8 solutions.
```

Our tests will have the following ranges for our two arguments:
```python
5 ≤ c_max ≤ 1000
1 ≤ num_sol ≤ 10
```
Happy coding!!
