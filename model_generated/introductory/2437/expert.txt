 Given an array of positive integers arr, find a pattern of length m that is repeated k or more times. A pattern is a subarray (consecutive sub-sequence) that consists of one or more values, repeated multiple times consecutively without overlapping. A pattern is defined by its length and the number of repetitions. Return true if there exists a pattern of length m that is repeated k or more times, otherwise return false.
