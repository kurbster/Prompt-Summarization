 Write a function to balance the books. * The function should take one parameter: an object/dict with two or more name-value pairs which represent the members of the group and the amount spent by each. * The function should return an object/dict with the same names, showing how much money the members should pay or receive. **Further points:** * The values should be positive numbers if the person should receive money from the group, negative numbers if they owe money to the group. * If value is a decimal, round to two decimal places.   Translations and comments (and upvotes!) welcome. ### Example 3 friends go out together
