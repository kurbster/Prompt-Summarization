It's tricky keeping track of who is owed what when spending money in a group. Write a function to balance the books.

* The function should take one parameter: an object/dict with two or more name-value pairs which represent the members of the group and the amount spent by each.
* The function should return an object/dict with the same names, showing how much money the members should pay or receive.

**Further points:**

* The values should be positive numbers if the person should receive money from the group, negative numbers if they owe money to the group.
* If value is a decimal, round to two decimal places.

### Example

3 friends go out together: A spends £20, B spends £15, and C spends £10. The function should return an object/dict showing that A should receive £5, B should receive £0, and C should pay £5.
