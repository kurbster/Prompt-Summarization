We have 3 equations with 3 unknowns x, y, and z and we are to solve for these unknowns.
Equations 4x -3y +z = -10, 2x +y +3z = 0, and -x +2y -5z = 17 will be passed in as an array of [[4, -3, 1, -10], [2, 1, 3, 0], [-1, 2, -5, 17]] and the result should be returned as an array like [1, 4, -2] (i.e. [x, y, z]).

Note: In C++ do not use new or malloc to allocate memory for the returned variable as allocated memory will not be freed in the Test Cases. Setting the variable as static will do.
