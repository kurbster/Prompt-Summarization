 Create a function finalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects. This function should take two arguments: exam - grade for exam (from 0 to 100); projects - number of completed projects (from 0 and above); This function should return a number (final grade). There are four types of final grades: - 100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10. - 90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75
