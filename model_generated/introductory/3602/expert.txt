 Given string s, return a list (or array) of pairs (or arrays)  [  (i1, s1),  (i2, s2),   ,  (in, sn) ], such that one can reconstruct the original string by replicating the character sx ix times and concatening all those strings. Your run-length encoding should be minimal, ie. for all i the values si and si+1 should differ.
