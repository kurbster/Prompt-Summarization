You must create a function, `spread`, that takes a function and a list of arguments to be applied to that function. You must make this function return the result of calling the given function/lambda with the given arguments.

eg:
```python
spread(someFunction, [1, true, "Foo", "bar"] ) 
# is the same as...
someFunction(1, true, "Foo", "bar")
```
