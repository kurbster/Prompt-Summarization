Vampire Numbers
----

Our loose definition of [Vampire Numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_number) can be described as follows:

```python
6 * 21 = 126
# 6 and 21 would be valid 'fangs' for a vampire number as the 
# digits 6, 1, and 2 are present in both the product and multiplicands

10 * 11 = 110
# 110 is not a vampire number since there are three 1's in the
# multiplicands, but only two 1's in the product
```

Create a function that can receive two 'fangs' and determine if the product of the two is a valid vampire number.
