You will be given a string and you task is to check if it is possible to convert that string into a palindrome by removing a single character. If the string is already a palindrome, return `"OK"`. If it is not, and we can convert it to a palindrome by removing one character, then return `"remove one"`, otherwise return `"not possible"`. The order of the characters should not be changed.

For example:
```Haskell
solve("abba") = "OK". -- This is a palindrome
solve("abbaa") = "remove one". -- remove the 'a' at the extreme right. 
solve("abbaab") = "not possible". 
```

More examples in the test cases. 

Good luck!
