Snuke's town has a subway system, consisting of N stations and M railway lines. The stations are numbered 1 through N. Each line is operated by a company. Each company has an identification number.
The i-th ( 1 \leq i \leq M ) line connects station p_i and q_i bidirectionally. There is no intermediate station. This line is operated by company c_i.
You can change trains at a station where multiple lines are available.
The fare system used in this subway system is a bit strange. When a passenger only uses lines that are operated by the same company, the fare is 1 yen (the currency of Japan). Whenever a passenger changes to a line that is operated by a different company from the current line, the passenger is charged an additional fare of 1 yen. In a case where a passenger who changed from some company A's line to another company's line changes to company A's line again, the additional fare is incurred again.
Snuke is now at station 1 and wants to travel to station N by subway. Find the minimum required fare.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 0 \leq M \leq 2×10^5
 - 1 \leq p_i \leq N (1 \leq i \leq M)
 - 1 \leq q_i \leq N (1 \leq i \leq M)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 10^6 (1 \leq i \leq M)
 - p_i \neq q_i (1 \leq i \leq M)

-----Input-----
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
p_1 q_1 c_1
:
p_M q_M c_M

-----Output-----
Print the minimum required fare. If it is impossible to get to station N by subway, print -1 instead.

-----Sample Input-----
3 3
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 1 2

-----Sample Output-----
1

Use company 1's lines: 1 → 2 → 3. The fare is 1 yen.
