Iahub likes trees very much. Recently he discovered an interesting tree named propagating tree. The tree consists of n nodes numbered from 1 to n, each node i having an initial value a_{i}. The root of the tree is node 1.

This tree has a special property: when a value val is added to a value of node i, the value -val is added to values of all the children of node i. Note that when you add value -val to a child of node i, you also add -(-val) to all children of the child of node i and so on. Look an example explanation to understand better how it works.

This tree supports two types of queries:

  "1 x val" — val is added to the value of node x;  "2 x" — print the current value of node x. 

In order to help Iahub understand the tree better, you must answer m queries of the preceding type.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200000). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000). Each of the next n–1 lines contains two integers v_{i} and u_{i} (1 ≤ v_{i}, u_{i} ≤ n), meaning that there is an edge between nodes v_{i} and u_{i}.

Each of the next m lines contains a query in the format described above. It is guaranteed that the following constraints hold for all queries: 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ val ≤ 1000.


-----Output-----

For each query of type two (print the value of node x) you must print the answer to the query on a separate line. The queries must be answered in the order given in the input.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 5
1 2 1 1 2
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
1 2 3
1 1 2
2 1
2 2
2 4

Output
3
3
0



-----Note-----

The values of the nodes are [1, 2, 1, 1, 2] at the beginning.

Then value 3 is added to node 2. It propagates and value -3 is added to it's sons, node 4 and node 5. Then it cannot propagate any more. So the values of the nodes are [1, 5, 1,  - 2,  - 1].

Then value 2 is added to node 1. It propagates and value -2 is added to it's sons, node 2 and node 3. From node 2 it propagates again, adding value 2 to it's sons, node 4 and node 5. Node 3 has no sons, so it cannot propagate from there. The values of the nodes are [3, 3,  - 1, 0, 1].
