 Process the following Q queries:  - In the i-th query, you are given two positive integers A_i and B_i. Assuming that Takahashi was ranked A_i-th in the first contest and B_i-th in the second contest, find the maximum possible number of participants whose scores are smaller than Takahashi's.
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: Q A_1 B_1 : A_Q B_Q -----Output----- For each query, print the maximum possible number of participants whose scores are smaller than Takahashi's. -----Sample Input----- 8 1 4 10 5 3 3 4 11 8 9 22 40 8 36 314159265 358979323 -----Sample Output----- 1 12 4 11 14 57 31 671644785 Let us denote a participant who was ranked x-th in the first contest and y-th in the second contest as (x,y). In the first query, (2,1) is a possible candidate of a participant whose score is smaller than Takahashi's. There are never two or more participants whose scores are smaller than Takahashi's, so we should print 1.
