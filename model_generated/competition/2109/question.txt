10^{10^{10}} participants, including Takahashi, competed in two programming contests.
In each contest, all participants had distinct ranks from first through 10^{10^{10}}-th.
The score of a participant is the product of his/her ranks in the two contests.
Process the following Q queries:
 - In the i-th query, you are given two positive integers A_i and B_i. Assuming that Takahashi was ranked A_i-th in the first contest and B_i-th in the second contest, find the maximum possible number of participants whose scores are smaller than Takahashi's.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq Q \leq 100
 - 1\leq A_i,B_i\leq 10^9(1\leq i\leq Q)
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
Q
A_1 B_1
:
A_Q B_Q

-----Output-----
For each query, print the maximum possible number of participants whose scores are smaller than Takahashi's.

Let us denote a participant who was ranked x-th in the first contest and y-th in the second contest as (x,y).
In the first query, (2,1) is a possible candidate of a participant whose score is smaller than Takahashi's. There are never two or more participants whose scores are smaller than Takahashi's, so we should print 1.
