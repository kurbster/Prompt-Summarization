Let's call two strings $s$ and $t$ anagrams of each other if it is possible to rearrange symbols in the string $s$ to get a string, equal to $t$.

Let's consider two strings $s$ and $t$ which are anagrams of each other. We say that $t$ is a reducible anagram of $s$ if there exists an integer $k \ge 2$ and $2k$ non-empty strings $s_1, t_1, s_2, t_2, \dots, s_k, t_k$ that satisfy the following conditions:

  If we write the strings $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_k$ in order, the resulting string will be equal to $s$;  If we write the strings $t_1, t_2, \dots, t_k$ in order, the resulting string will be equal to $t$;  For all integers $i$ between $1$ and $k$ inclusive, $s_i$ and $t_i$ are anagrams of each other. 

If such strings don't exist, then $t$ is said to be an irreducible anagram of $s$. Note that these notions are only defined when $s$ and $t$ are anagrams of each other.

For example, consider the string $s = $ "gamegame". Then the string $t = $ "megamage" is a reducible anagram of $s$, we may choose for example $s_1 = $ "game", $s_2 = $ "gam", $s_3 = $ "e" and $t_1 = $ "mega", $t_2 = $ "mag", $t_3 = $ "e":

On the other hand, we can prove that $t = $ "memegaga" is an irreducible anagram of $s$.

You will be given a string $s$ and $q$ queries, represented by two integers $1 \le l \le r \le |s|$ (where $|s|$ is equal to the length of the string $s$). For each query, you should find if the substring of $s$ formed by characters from the $l$-th to the $r$-th has at least one irreducible anagram.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a string $s$, consisting of lowercase English characters ($1 \le |s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).

The second line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 10^5$)  — the number of queries.

Each of the following $q$ lines contain two integers $l$ and $r$ ($1 \le l \le r \le |s|$), representing a query for the substring of $s$ formed by characters from the $l$-th to the $r$-th.


-----Output-----

For each query, print a single line containing "Yes" (without quotes) if the corresponding substring has at least one irreducible anagram, and a single line containing "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

-----Note-----

In the first sample, in the first and third queries, the substring is "a", which has itself as an irreducible anagram since two or more non-empty strings cannot be put together to obtain "a". On the other hand, in the second query, the substring is "aaa", which has no irreducible anagrams: its only anagram is itself, and we may choose $s_1 = $ "a", $s_2 = $ "aa", $t_1 = $ "a", $t_2 = $ "aa" to show that it is a reducible anagram.

In the second query of the second sample, the substring is "abb", which has, for example, "bba" as an irreducible anagram.
