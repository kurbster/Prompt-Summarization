Appleman has a tree with n vertices. Some of the vertices (at least one) are colored black and other vertices are colored white.

Consider a set consisting of k (0 ≤ k < n) edges of Appleman's tree. If Appleman deletes these edges from the tree, then it will split into (k + 1) parts. Note, that each part will be a tree with colored vertices.

Now Appleman wonders, what is the number of sets splitting the tree in such a way that each resulting part will have exactly one black vertex? Find this number modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer n (2  ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of tree vertices. 

The second line contains the description of the tree: n - 1 integers p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n} - 2 (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ i). Where p_{i} means that there is an edge connecting vertex (i + 1) of the tree and vertex p_{i}. Consider tree vertices are numbered from 0 to n - 1.

The third line contains the description of the colors of the vertices: n integers x_0, x_1, ..., x_{n} - 1 (x_{i} is either 0 or 1). If x_{i} is equal to 1, vertex i is colored black. Otherwise, vertex i is colored white.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the number of ways to split the tree modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).
