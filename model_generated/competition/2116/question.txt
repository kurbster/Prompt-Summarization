You are given a string s, consisting of lowercase English letters, and the integer m.

One should choose some symbols from the given string so that any contiguous subsegment of length m has at least one selected symbol. Note that here we choose positions of symbols, not the symbols themselves.

Then one uses the chosen symbols to form a new string. All symbols from the chosen position should be used, but we are allowed to rearrange them in any order.

Formally, we choose a subsequence of indices 1 ≤ i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_{t} ≤ |s|. The selected sequence must meet the following condition: for every j such that 1 ≤ j ≤ |s| - m + 1, there must be at least one selected index that belongs to the segment [j,  j + m - 1], i.e. there should exist a k from 1 to t, such that j ≤ i_{k} ≤ j + m - 1.

Then we take any permutation p of the selected indices and form a new string s_{i}_{p}_1s_{i}_{p}_2... s_{i}_{p}_{t}.

Find the lexicographically smallest string, that can be obtained using this procedure.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000).

The second line contains the string s consisting of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that this string is non-empty and its length doesn't exceed 100 000. It is also guaranteed that the number m doesn't exceed the length of the string s.


-----Output-----

Print the single line containing the lexicographically smallest string, that can be obtained using the procedure described above.

Output
aaabb



-----Note-----

In the first sample, one can choose the subsequence {3} and form a string "a".

In the second sample, one can choose the subsequence {1, 2, 4} (symbols on this positions are 'a', 'b' and 'a') and rearrange the chosen symbols to form a string "aab".
