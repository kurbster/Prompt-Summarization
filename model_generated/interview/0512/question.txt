There is a tree with N vertices numbered 1 to N.
The i-th edge in this tree connects Vertex a_i and Vertex b_i, and the color and length of that edge are c_i and d_i, respectively.
Here the color of each edge is represented by an integer between 1 and N-1 (inclusive). The same integer corresponds to the same color, and different integers correspond to different colors.
Answer the following Q queries:
 - Query j (1 \leq j \leq Q): assuming that the length of every edge whose color is x_j is changed to y_j, find the distance between Vertex u_j and Vertex v_j. (The changes of the lengths of edges do not affect the subsequent queries.)

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq Q \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq N
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq N-1
 - 1 \leq d_i \leq 10^4
 - 1 \leq x_j \leq N-1
 - 1 \leq y_j \leq 10^4
 - 1 \leq u_j < v_j \leq N
 - The given graph is a tree.
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N Q
a_1 b_1 c_1 d_1
:
a_{N-1} b_{N-1} c_{N-1} d_{N-1}
x_1 y_1 u_1 v_1
:
x_Q y_Q u_Q v_Q

-----Output-----
Print Q lines. The j-th line (1 \leq j \leq Q) should contain the answer to Query j.

-----Sample Input-----
5 3
1 2 1 10
1 3 2 20
2 4 4 30
5 2 1 40
1 100 1 4
1 100 1 5
3 1000 3 4

-----Sample Output-----
130
200
60

The graph in this input is as follows:

Here the edges of Color 1 are shown as solid red lines, the edge of Color 2 is shown as a bold green line, and the edge of Color 4 is shown as a blue dashed line.
 - Query 1: Assuming that the length of every edge whose color is 1 is changed to 100, the distance between Vertex 1 and Vertex 4 is 100 + 30 = 130.
 - Query 2: Assuming that the length of every edge whose color is 1 is changed to 100, the distance between Vertex 1 and Vertex 5 is 100 + 100 = 200.
 - Query 3: Assuming that the length of every edge whose color is 3 is changed to 1000 (there is no such edge), the distance between Vertex 3 and Vertex 4 is 20 + 10 + 30 = 60. Note that the edges of Color 1 now have their original lengths.
