 You are given integers $N$ and $W$. Find the number of positive integers with $N$ digits (without leading zeroes) and weight equal to $W$. Compute this number modulo $10^9+7$. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $W$ denoting the number of digits and the required weight. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of $N$-digit positive integers with weight $W$, modulo $10^9+7$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 10^5$ - $2 \le N \le 10^{18}$ - $|W| \le 300$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (20 points): - $1 \le T \le 10^3$ - $2 \le N \le 10^3$ Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 1 2 3 -----Example Output----- 6 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: Remember that the digits are arranged from most significant to least significant as $D_1, D_2$. The two-digit integers with weight $3$ are $14, 25, 36, 47, 58, 69$. For example, the weight of $14$ is $D_2-D_1 = 4-1 = 3$. We can see that there are no other possible numbers.
