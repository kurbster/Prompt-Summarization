Many things in this first paragraph are references to some pretty famous YouTube stars, so be careful about rephrasing. Thanks! 
Michael, Kevin and Jake are sharing a cake, in celebration of their Webby award. They named it VCake. Unlike other cakes they considered, this one has finite volume and surface area. It's shaped as a normal rectangular cake with dimensions R centimeters by C centimeters. For the purposes of this problem, we can forget about three dimensions and think of a cake as just a 2D rectangle.
Chef will now cut the cake into three pieces, one for each person. However, the cake's shape and Chef's really old tools pose a few restrictions:

- Chef can only cut the cake, or a cake piece, across a line parallel to one of its sides. 
- Chef can only cut the cake, or a cake piece, from end to end. That is, she cannot cut the cake partially. 
- Chef can only cut the cake, or a cake piece, such that the sides of the resulting pieces (which will be rectangular in shape) are integers. 

In addition, Michael, Kevin and Jake also have a few preferences of their own:

- They want their pieces to be connected (in one piece), and rectangular in shape.
- Michael wants his piece to have an area exactly M square centimeters. (Again, forget about a third dimension.)
- Kevin wants his piece to have an area exactly K square centimeters.
- Jake wants his piece to have an area exactly J square centimeters.

With these restrictions, Chef is at a loss. Is it possible for Chef to accomplish this task? Please note that the entire cake should be used. There should be no leftover cake.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line containing five space separated integers R, C M, K and J.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing either “Yes” or “No” (without quotes), denoting whether Chef can accomplish the task or not.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 105
- 1 ≤ R, C ≤ 109
- 1 ≤ M, K, J ≤ 1018

-----Example-----
Input:4
4 5 10 4 6
4 5 6 10 4
4 5 4 6 10
2 2 2 2 2

Output:Yes
Yes
Yes
No

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1. In this case, Chef can accomplish the task by doing the following slicing.

Example case 4. Here, Michael, Kevin and Jake each wants a piece with area 2, but the total area of the cake is only 2×2 = 4. This means the task is impossible.
