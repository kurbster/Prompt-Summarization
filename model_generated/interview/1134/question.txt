-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.

First 3 attacks add 1,2,3 to his army making it 6. (1+2+3 = 6)

Then he looses 2 and 3 making it 1. (6-2-3 = 1)

He conquers all so VICTORY.

Example case 2.

First 2 attacks add 4,4 to his army making it 8. (4+4 = 8)

Then he looses 2,2,2,2 making it 0. (8-2-2-2-2 = 0)

He conquers all so VICTORY.

Example case 3.

First 4 attacks add 10,10,10,10 to his army making it 40. (10+10+10+10 = 40)

Then he looses 25 and then all 15 out of possible 30 making it 0. (40-25-15 = 0)

He is defeated on 6th attack so DEFEAT.
