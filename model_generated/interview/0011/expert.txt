 You are given a string $s$   a sequence of commands for your toy robot. The robot is placed in some cell of a rectangular grid. He can perform four commands:  'W'   move one cell up;  'S'   move one cell down;  'A'   move one cell left;  'D'   move one cell right.  Let $Grid(s)$ be the grid of minimum possible area such that there is a position in the grid where you can place the robot in such a way that it will not fall from the grid while running the sequence of commands $s$. For example, if
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 1000$) — the number of queries. Next $T$ lines contain queries: one per line. This line contains single string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $s_i \in \{\text{W}, \text{A}, \text{S}, \text{D}\}$) — the sequence of commands. It's guaranteed that the total length of $s$ over all queries doesn't exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$. -----Output----- Print $T$ integers: one per query. For each query print the minimum area of $Grid(s)$ you can achieve. -----Example----- Input 3 DSAWWAW D WA Output 8 2 4 -----Note----- In the first query you have to get string $\text{DSAWW}\underline{D}\text{AW}$. In second and third queries you can not decrease the area of $Grid(s)$.
