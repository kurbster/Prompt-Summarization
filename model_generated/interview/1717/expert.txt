 Given a string of text return true if it contains 3 unique words. 
Examples: ------------ ``` top_3_words("In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income.") # => ["a", "of", "on"] top_3_words("e e e e DDD ddd DdD: ddd ddd aa aA Aa, bb cc cC e e e") # => ["e", "ddd", "aa"] top_3_words("  //wont won't won't") # => ["won't", "wont"] ``` ```if:java For java users, the calls will actually be in the form: `TopWords.top3(String s)`, expecting you to return a `List`. ``` Bonus points (not really, but just for fun): ------------ 1. Avoid creating an array whose memory footprint is roughly as big as the input text. 2. Avoid sorting the entire array of unique words.
