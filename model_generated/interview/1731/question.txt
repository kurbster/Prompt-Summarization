Esoteric languages are pretty hard to program, but it's fairly interesting to write interpreters for them!

Your task is to write a method which will interpret Befunge-93 code! Befunge-93 is a language in which the code is presented not as a series of instructions, but as instructions scattered on a 2D plane; your pointer **starts at the top-left corner** and defaults to **moving right** through the code. Note that the instruction pointer **wraps** around the screen! There is a singular stack which we will assume is unbounded and only contain integers. While Befunge-93 code is supposed to be restricted to 80x25, you need not be concerned with code size. Befunge-93 supports the following instructions (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befunge)):

- `0-9` Push this number onto the stack.
- `+` Addition: Pop `a` and `b`, then push `a+b`.
- `-` Subtraction: Pop `a` and `b`, then push `b-a`.
- `*` Multiplication: Pop `a` and `b`, then push `a*b`.
- `/` Integer division: Pop `a` and `b`, then push `b/a`, rounded down. If `a` is zero, push zero.
- `%` Modulo: Pop `a` and `b`, then push the `b%a`. If `a` is zero, push zero.
- `!`   Logical NOT: Pop a value. If the value is zero, push `1`; otherwise, push zero.
- ``` ` ``` (backtick) Greater than: Pop `a` and `b`, then push `1` if `b>a`, otherwise push zero.
- `>` Start moving right.
- `<` Start moving left.
- `^` Start moving up.
- `v` Start moving down.
- `?` Start moving in a random cardinal direction.
- `_` Pop a value; move right if `value = 0`, left otherwise.
- `|` Pop a value; move down if `value = 0`, up otherwise.
- `"` Start string mode: push each character's ASCII value all the way up to the next `"`.
- `:` Duplicate value on top of the stack. If there is nothing on top of the stack, push a `0`.
- `\` Swap two values on top of the stack. If there is only one value, pretend there is an extra `0` on bottom of the stack.
- `$` Pop value from the stack and discard it.
- `.` Pop value and output as an integer.
- `,` Pop value and output the ASCII character represented by the integer code that is stored in the value.
- `#` Trampoline: Skip next cell.
- `p` A "put" call (a way to store a value for later use). Pop `y`, `x` and `v`, then change the character at the position `(x,y)` in the program to the character with ASCII value `v`.
- `g` A "get" call (a way to retrieve data in storage). Pop `y` and `x`, then push ASCII value of the character at that position in the program.
- `@` End program.
- ` ` (i.e. a space)    No-op. Does nothing.

The above list is slightly modified: you'll notice if you look at the Wikipedia page that we do not use the user input instructions and dividing by zero simply yields zero.

Here's an example:

```
>987v>.v
v456<  :
>321 ^ _@
```

will create the output `123456789`.

So what you must do is create a function such that when you pass in the Befunge code, the function returns the output that would be generated by the code. So, for example:

```
"123456789".equals(new BefungeInterpreter().interpret(">987v>.v\nv456<  :\n>321 ^ _@")
```

This test case will be added for you.
