Every great chef knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representations contain only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.  

Our chef has recently returned from the Lucky country. He observed that every restaurant in the Lucky country had a lucky number as its name. 
He believes that having a lucky number as a restaurant name can indeed turn out to be very lucky.  

Our chef believes that it is possible to make a lucky number having N digits even luckier. Any number following the rules below is called Lucky lucky number -  

1. The number contains only digits 4 and 7. 

2. Count of digit 4 in the number should be divisible by 7. 

3. Count of digit 7 in the number should be divisible by 4. 

Help our chef to compute the count of digit 4 in the smallest Lucky lucky number having N digits. 

-----Input-----

First line contains T, number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains a number N, the number of digits in the Lucky lucky number to be formed. 

1<=T<=1000 

1<=N<=1000000000 (10^9) 

-----Output-----

If it is not possible to form a Lucky lucky number having N digits, output -1.
Otherwise, output the count of digit 4 in the smallest Lucky lucky number having N digits.

-----Example-----
Input:
5
7
4
11
1
15

Output:
7
0
7
-1
7

Explanation
For the last test case, N = 15, the smallest lucky lucky number is
444444477777777. The count of digit 4 is 7.
