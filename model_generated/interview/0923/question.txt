Like all minions Dave also like to eat bananas. So as to his obsession, he is eating banana, but this time in different way. There are N bananas in dish. Dave wants to eat all of them. He starts eating at speed 1 banana/second. He can increase or decrease speed of eating by one only. The condition is that he must end eating at speed 1 banana/second. So, your task is to find minimum time required to finish all bananas in a dish.

-----Input-----
First line contain number of test cases T. Next T lines contain one integer N. Where N is number of bananas in a dish.

-----Output-----
For each test case print minimum time require to eat all N bananas.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 105

-----Example-----
Input:
2
2
4

Output:
2
3


-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.Dave will start to eat with rate of 1 banana/second. Then only one banana will remain. He will eat that banana in 1 second. Thus, Total time is 2 seconds.
Example case 2.Dave starts with rate of 1 banana/second, and then increase it to 2 bananas/second and again decrease it to 1 banana/second. So total time is 3 seconds.
