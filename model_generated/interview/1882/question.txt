Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

Example:


Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.

Note:


       Your algorithm should use only constant extra space.
       You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.
