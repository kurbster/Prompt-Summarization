The aim is to calculate `exponential(x)` (written `exp(x)` in most math libraries) as an irreducible fraction, the numerator of this fraction having a given number of digits.

We call this function `expand`, it takes two parameters, `x` of which we want to evaluate the exponential, `digits` which is the required number of digits for the numerator. 

The function `expand` will return an array of the form `[numerator, denominator]`; we stop the loop in the Taylor expansion (see references below) when the numerator has a number of digits `>=` the required number of digits

# Examples:
```
expand(1, 2) --> 65/24 (we will write this [65, 24] or (65, 24) in Haskell; 
65/24 ~ 2.708...)

expand(2, 5) --> [20947, 2835]

expand(3, 10) --> [7205850259, 358758400]

expand(1.5, 10) --> [36185315027,8074035200]
```
**Note**
```expand(1,5) = [109601, 40320]``` is the same as ```expand(1, 6)```

#Method:
As said above the way here is to use `Taylor expansion` of the exponential function though it is not always the best approximation by a rational.
