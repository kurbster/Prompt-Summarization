 Given two strings str1 and str2, return the shortest string that has both str1 and str2 as subsequences. If multiple answers exist, you may return any of them. (A string S is a subsequence of string T if deleting some number of characters from T (possibly 0, and the characters are chosen anywhere from T) results in the string S.)   Example 1: Input: str1 = "abac", str2 = "cab" Output: "cabac" Explanation:  str1 = "abac
