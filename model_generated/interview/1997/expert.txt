 Given a list of intervals, remove all intervals that are covered by another interval in the list. Interval [a,b) is covered by interval [c,d) if and only if c <= a and b <= d. After doing so, return the number of remaining intervals.   Example 1: Input: intervals = [[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]] Output: 2 Explanation: Interval [3,6] is covered by [2,8], therefore it is removed. Example 2: Input: intervals
