 Given the root of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value. After deleting all nodes with a value in to_delete, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees). Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest.  You may return the result in any order.   Example 1: Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5] Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]
