Our Chef is doing what he is best at, COOKING A BARBECUE for his guests. He has invited all of us, and taking the help of his apprentice to smoke the barbecues. The chef has got BBQ sticks, each can take N fillings, and he presents N distinctly filled sticks in front his guests forming a N*N  matrix

But here is the problem, he has got only two type of fillings, meat and capsicum, but still wants the N  sticks to look "presentable", he is very particular about it. As a solution he fills the main diagonal of the N*N  matrix with the same type of filling (either meat or capsicum) forming a "presentable" set

The Chef's apprentice is a fool, so the Chef asks him to cook M distinctly filled sticks ,so that the Chef is sure that among M there exist N sticks forming a "presentable" set. Your job is to determine smallest possible value of M.
