To help Lavanya learn all about binary numbers and binary sequences, her father has bought her a collection of square tiles, each of which has either a 0 or a 1 written on it. Her brother Nikhil has played a rather nasty prank. He has glued together pairs of tiles with 0 written on them. Lavanya now has square tiles with 1 on them and rectangular tiles with two 0's on them, made up of two square tiles with 0 stuck together). Thus, she can no longer make all possible binary sequences using these tiles.
To amuse herself, Lavanya has decided to pick a number $N$ and try and construct as many binary sequences of length $N$ as possible using her collection of tiles. For example if $N$ = 1, she can only make the sequence 1. For $N$=2, she can make 11 and 00. For $N$=4, there are 5 possibilities: 0011, 0000, 1001, 1100 and 1111.
Lavanya would like you to write a program to compute the number of arrangements possible with $N$ tiles so that she can verify that she has generated all of them. Since she cannot count beyond 15746, it is sufficient to report this number modulo 15746.

-----Input:-----
A single line with a single integer $N$.

-----Output:-----
A single integer indicating the number of binary sequences of length $N$, modulo 15746, that Lavanya can make using her tiles.

-----Constraints:-----
You may assume that $N \leq$ 1000000.

-----Sample Input:-----
4

-----Sample Output:-----
5

-----Explanation:-----
This corresponds to the example discussed above.
