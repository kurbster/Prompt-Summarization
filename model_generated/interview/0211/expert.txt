  Given a string s, return the maximum number of unique substrings that the given string can be split into. You can split string s into any list of non-empty substrings, where the concatenation of the substrings forms the original string. However, you must split the substrings such that all of them are unique. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.  Constraints: 1 <= s.length <= 16 s contains only lower case English letters.
