 Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree.  Each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children. Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.   Example 1: Input: [0,0,null,0,0] Output: 1 Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown. Example 2: Input: [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0] Output: 2
