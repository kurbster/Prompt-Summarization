Given a string s, determine if it is valid.
A string s is valid if, starting with an empty string t = "", you can transform t into s after performing the following operation any number of times:

Insert string "abc" into any position in t. More formally, t becomes tleft + "abc" + tright, where t == tleft + tright. Note that tleft and tright may be empty.

Return true if s is a valid string, otherwise, return false.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "aabcbc"
Output: true
Explanation:
"" -> "abc" -> "aabcbc"
Thus, "aabcbc" is valid.
Example 2:
Input: s = "abcabcababcc"
Output: true
Explanation:
"" -> "abc" -> "abcabc" -> "abcabcabc" -> "abcabcababcc"
Thus, "abcabcababcc" is valid.

Example 3:
Input: s = "abccba"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to get "abccba" using the operation.

Example 4:
Input: s = "cababc"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to get "cababc" using the operation.

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 2 * 104
s consists of letters 'a', 'b', and 'c'
