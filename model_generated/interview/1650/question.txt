We want to generate all the numbers of three digits where:

- the sum of their digits is equal to 10.

- their digits are in increasing order (the numbers may have two or more equal contiguous digits)

The numbers that fulfill the two above constraints are: ```118, 127, 136, 145, 226, 235, 244, 334```

Make a function that receives two arguments:

- the sum of digits value 

- the desired number of digits for the numbers

The function should output an array with three values: \[1,2,3\]

1 - the total number of possible numbers

2 - the minimum number

3 - the maximum number

The example given above should be:

```python
find_all(10, 3) == [8, 118, 334]
```

If we have only one possible number as a solution, it should output a result like the one below:

```python
find_all(27, 3) == [1, 999, 999]
```

If there are no possible numbers, the function should output the empty array.

```python
find_all(84, 4) == []
```

The number of solutions climbs up when the number of digits increases.

```python
find_all(35, 6) == [123, 116999, 566666]
```

Features of the random tests:

* Number of tests: `112`
* Sum of digits value between `20` and `65`
* Amount of digits between `2` and `17`
