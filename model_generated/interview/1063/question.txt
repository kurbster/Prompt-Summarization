Write a program to find the remainder when an integer A is divided by an integer B.

-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer T, the total number of test cases. Then T lines follow, each line contains two Integers A and B. 

-----Output-----
For each test case, find the remainder when A is divided by  B, and display it in a new line.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ A,B ≤ 10000

-----Example-----
Input
