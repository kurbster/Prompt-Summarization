Given two different positions on a chess board, find the least number of moves it would take a knight to get from one to the other.
The positions will be passed as two arguments in algebraic notation.
For example, `knight("a3", "b5")` should return 1.

The knight is not allowed to move off the board.
The board is 8x8.
