 You are given two integers A and B, count of first guard and second guard respectively. Help the boss to count the minimum and maximum number of times Chef could have entered into the office building. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of the T test cases follows.  Each test case consists of a line containing two space separated integers A and B. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing two space separated integers, the minimum and maximum number of times Chef could have entered into the office building. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 - 0 ≤ A, B ≤ 1000000 -----Example----- Input: 1 19 17 Output: 19 36
