 Given a two dimensional matrix A where each value is 0 or 1. A move consists of choosing any row or column, and toggling each value in that row or column: changing all 0s to 1s, and all 1s to 0s. After making any number of moves, every row of this matrix is interpreted as a binary number, and the score of the matrix is the sum of these numbers. Return the highest possible score.   Example 1: Input: [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,1,0]
