 You are given an array x of n positive numbers. You start at point (0,0) and moves x[0] metres to the north, then x[1] metres to the west,     x[2] metres to the south,     x[3] metres to the east and so on. In other words, after each move your direction changes     counter-clockwise.     Write a one-pass algorithm with O(1) extra space to determine, if your path crosses itself, or not.
