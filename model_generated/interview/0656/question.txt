Write a program to obtain a number $N$ and increment its value by 1 if the number is divisible by 4 $otherwise$ decrement its value by 1.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain a number $N$.

-----Output:-----
Output a single line, the new value of the number.

-----Constraints-----
- $0 \leq N \leq 1000$

-----Sample Input:-----
5

-----Sample Output:-----
4

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Since 5 is not divisible by 4 hence, its value is decreased by 1.
