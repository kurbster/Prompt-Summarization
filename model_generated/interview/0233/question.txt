In a N x N grid composed of 1 x 1 squares, each 1 x 1 square consists of a /, \, or blank space.  These characters divide the square into contiguous regions.
(Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a \ is represented as "\\".)
Return the number of regions.
 













Example 1:
Input:
[
  " /",
  "/ "
]
Output: 2
Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:



Example 2:
Input:
[
  " /",
  "  "
]
Output: 1
Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:



Example 3:
Input:
[
  "\\/",
  "/\\"
]
Output: 4
Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "\\/" refers to \/, and "/\\" refers to /\.)
The 2x2 grid is as follows:



Example 4:
Input:
[
  "/\\",
  "\\/"
]
Output: 5
Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "/\\" refers to /\, and "\\/" refers to \/.)
The 2x2 grid is as follows:



Example 5:
Input:
[
  "//",
  "/ "
]
Output: 3
Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:


 
Note:

1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 30
grid[i][j] is either '/', '\', or ' '.
