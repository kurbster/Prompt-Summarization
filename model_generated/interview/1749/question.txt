A factorial (of a large number) will usually contain some trailing zeros.
Your job is to make a function that calculates the number of trailing zeros, in any given base.

Factorial is defined like this:
```n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * ... * n-2 * n-1 * n```

Here's two examples to get you started:

```python
trailing_zeros(15, 10) == 3
#15! = 1307674368000, which has 3 zeros at the end

trailing_zeros(7, 2) == 4
#7! = 5030 = 0b1001110110000, which has 4 zeros at the end
```

Your code should be able to handle some very large numbers, so write some smart code.

Note: ```num``` will be a non-negative integer, ```base``` will be an integer larger or equal to two.
