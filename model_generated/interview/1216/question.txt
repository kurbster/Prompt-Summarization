Today Chef wants to evaluate the dishes of his $N$ students. He asks each one to cook a dish and present it to him.
Chef loves his secret ingredient, and only likes dishes with at least $X$ grams of it.
Given $N$, $X$ and the amount of secret ingredient used by each student $A_i$, find out whether Chef will like at least one dish. 

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- The first line of each testcase contains two integers $N$ 
(number of students) and $X$ (minimum amount of secret ingredient that a dish must contain for Chef to like it).
- The next line contains $N$ space separated integers, $A_i$ denoting the amount of secret ingredient used by the students in their dishes.

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, print a single string "YES" if Chef likes at least one dish. Otherwise, print "NO". (Without quotes).

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq X \leq 1000000$
- $1 \leq A_i \leq 1000000$
