Create a function that takes a positive integer and returns the next bigger number that can be formed by rearranging its digits. For example:

```
12 ==> 21
513 ==> 531
2017 ==> 2071
```

If the digits can't be rearranged to form a bigger number, return `-1` (or `nil` in Swift):

```
9 ==> -1
111 ==> -1
531 ==> -1
```
