 Given an array of integers arr and an integer target. You have to find two non-overlapping sub-arrays of arr each with sum equal target. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is minimum. Return the minimum sum of the lengths of the two required sub-arrays, or return -1 if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.   Example 1: Input: arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3 Output: 2 Explanation: Only two sub-arrays have sum =
