Chef and Paja are bored, so they are playing an infinite game of ping pong. The rules of the game are as follows:
- The players play an infinite number of games. At the end of each game, the player who won it scores a point.
- In each game, one of the players serves. Chef serves in the first game.
- After every $K$ points are scored (regardless of which players scored them), i.e. whenever $K$ games have been played since the last time the serving player changed, the player that serves in the subsequent games changes: if Chef served in the game that just finished, then Paja will serve in the next game and all subsequent games until the serving player changes again; if Paja served, then Chef will serve.
The players got a little too caught up in the game and they forgot who is supposed to serve in the next game. Will you help them determine that? So far, Chef has scored $X$ points and Paja has scored $Y$ points.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $X$, $Y$ and $K$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Chef" if Chef is supposed to serve next or "Paja" otherwise (without quotes).

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 50$
- $0 \le X, Y \le 10^9$
- $1 \le K \le 10^9$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
3
1 3 3
5 7 2
38657 76322 564

-----Example Output-----
Paja
Chef
Paja

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: Chef served for the first three games, after that Paja started serving. He only served in one game, so he is supposed to serve next.
