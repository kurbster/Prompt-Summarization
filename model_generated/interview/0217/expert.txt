 Given an array of integers, return the number of distinct values. 
Example 1: Input: [0] Output: 1 Explanation:  There is only one possible result: 0. Example 2: Input: [1,1,2] Output: 3 Explanation:  The possible subarrays are [1], [1], [2], [1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 1, 2]. These yield the results 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3. There are 3 unique values, so the answer is 3. Example 3: Input: [1,2,4] Output: 6 Explanation:  The possible results are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7.   Note: 1 <= A.length <= 50000 0 <= A[i] <= 10^9
