In the 2-D world of Flatland, the Circles were having their sports day and wanted to end it with a nice formation. So, they called upon Mr. Sphere from Spaceland for help. Mr Sphere decides to arrange the Circles in square formations. He starts with $N$ Circles and forms the largest possible square using these Circles. He then takes the remaining Circles and repeats the procedure. A square of side $S$ requires $S^2$ Circles to create.
Find the number of squares he will be able to form at the end of the process.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$.

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output a single integer denoting the number of squares.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$

-----Sample Input:-----
2

85

114          

-----Sample Output:-----
2

4

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Test case 1 : Mr Sphere forms a square of side 9 using 81 Circles and then forms a square of side 2 using the remaining 4.
