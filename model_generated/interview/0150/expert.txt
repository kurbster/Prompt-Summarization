 Given an array A, partition it into two (contiguous) subarrays left and right so that: Every element in left is less than or equal to every element in right. left and right are non-empty. left has the smallest possible size. Return the length of left after such a partitioning.  It is guaranteed that such a partitioning exists.   Example 1: Input: [5,0,3,8,6] Output: 3 Explanation: left = [5,0,3], right = [8,6] Example 2: Input
