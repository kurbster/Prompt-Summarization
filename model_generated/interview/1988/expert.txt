 Consider a directed graph, with nodes labelled 0, 1, ..., n-1. In this graph, each edge is either red or blue, and there could be self-edges or parallel edges. Each [i, j] in red_edges denotes a red directed edge from node i to node j.  Similarly, each [i, j] in blue_edges denotes a blue directed edge from node i to node j. Return an array answer of length n, where each answer[X] is the length of the shortest path from
