 You are given a function $f$: $f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$. Your task is to find the maximum value of $f$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $tc$ ($1 \le tc \le 20$) — the number of test cases. Then $tc$ test cases follow. The first line of each test contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of problems in the contest. The second line of the test contains two real values $C, T$ ($0 < C < 10$, $0 \le T \le 2 \cdot 10^5$), where $C$ defines the efficiency of the training and $T$ is the duration of the contest in minutes. Value $C, T$ are given exactly with three digits after the decimal point. Each of the next $n$ lines of the test contain characteristics of the corresponding problem: two integers $a_i, p_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^4$, $1 \le p_i \le 10$) — the difficulty and the score of the problem. It is guaranteed that the value of $T$ is such that changing it by the $0.001$ in any direction will not change the test answer. Please note that in hacks you can only use $tc = 1$. -----Output----- Print $tc$ integers — the maximum possible score in each test case. -----Examples----- Input 2 4 1.000 31.000 12 3 20 6 30 1 5 1 3 1.000 30.000 1 10 10 10 20 8 Output 7 20 -----Note----- In the first example, Polycarp can get score of $7$ as follows:  Firstly he trains for $4$ minutes, increasing $s$ to the value of $5$;  Then he decides to solve $4$-th problem: he watches one episode in $10$ minutes, his skill level decreases to $s=5*0.9=4.5$ and then he solves the problem in $5/s=5/4.5$, which is roughly $1.111$ minutes;  Finally, he decides to solve $2$-nd problem: he watches one episode in $10$ minutes, his skill level decreases to $s=4.5*0.9=4.05$ and then he solves the problem in $20/s=20/4.05$, which is roughly $4.938$ minutes.  This way, Polycarp uses roughly $4+10+1.111+10+4.938=30.049$ minutes, to get score of $7$ points. It is not possible to achieve larger score in $31$ minutes. In the second example, Polycarp can get $20$ points as follows:  Firstly he trains for $4$ minutes, increasing $s$ to the value of $5$;  Then he decides to solve $1$-st problem: he watches one episode in $10$ minutes, his skill decreases to $s=5*0.9=4.5$ and then he solves problem in $1/s=1/4.5$, which is roughly $0.222$ minutes.  Finally, he decides to solve $2$-nd problem: he watches one episode in $10$ minutes, his skill decreases to $s=4.5*0.9=4.05$ and then he solves the problem in $10/s=10/4.05$, which is roughly $2.469$ minutes.  This way, Polycarp gets score of $20$ in $4+10+0.222+10+2.469=26.691$ minutes. It is not possible to achieve larger score in $30$ minutes.
