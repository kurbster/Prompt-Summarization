One day, Tanya was studying graph theory. She is very inquisitive, so the following problem soon came to her mind.
Find the number of undirected unweighted connected simple graphs with $N$ vertices (numbered $1$ through $N$) and $M$ edges, such that for each $i$ ($2 \le i \le N$), the shortest path from vertex $1$ to vertex $i$ is unique and its length is equal to $A_i$. In other words, for each $i$ ($2 \le i \le N$), there should be exactly one path with length $A_i$ between vertices $1$ and $i$, and there should be no paths with smaller length between these vertices.
Two graphs with $N$ vertices are distinct if we can find two vertices $u$ and $v$ such that there is an edge between these vertices in one graph, but not in the other graph.
Since the answer could be very large, compute it modulo $1,000,000,007$ ($10^9 + 7$).

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$.
- The second line contains $N - 1$ space-separated integers $A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of graphs modulo $10^9 + 7$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$
- $2 \le N \le 10^5$
- $N-1 \le M \le \mathrm{min}\left(2\cdot 10^5, \frac{N(N-1)}{2}\right)$
- $1 \le A_i \le N-1$ for each valid $i$
- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$
- the sum of $M$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (50 points): $M = N-1$
Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints
