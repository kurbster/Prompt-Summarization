Consider the following operations on a triple of integers. In one operation, you should:
- Choose an integer $d$ and an arithmetic operation ― either addition or multiplication.
- Choose a subset of elements of the triple.
- Apply the arithmetic operation to each of the chosen elements, i.e. either add $d$ to each of them or multiply each of them by $d$.
For example, if we have a triple $(3, 5, 7)$, we may choose to add $3$ to the first and third element, and we get $(6, 5, 10)$ using one operation.
You are given an initial triple $(p, q, r)$ and a target triple $(a, b, c)$. Find the minimum number of operations needed to transform $(p, q, r)$ into $(a, b, c)$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $p$, $q$ and $r$.
- The second line contains three space-separated integers $a$, $b$ and $c$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum required number of operations.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 1,000$
- $|p|, |q|, |r|, |a|, |b|, |c| \le 10^9$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (10 points): $|p|, |q|, |r|, |a|, |b|, |c| \le 10$
Subtask #2 (90 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
2
3 5 7
6 5 10
8 6 3
9 7 8

-----Example Output-----
1
2

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: We add $3$ to the first and third element of $(3, 5, 7)$ to form $(6, 5, 10)$.
Example case 2: We can add $1$ to each element to form $(9, 7, 4)$ and then multiply the third element by $2$.
