 Given 3 positives numbers a, b and c. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of a and b to make ( a OR b == c ). (bitwise OR operation). Flip operation consists of change any single bit 1 to 0 or change the bit 0 to 1 in their binary representation.   Example 1: Input: a = 2, b = 6, c = 5 Output: 3 Explanation: After flips a = 1 , b = 4
