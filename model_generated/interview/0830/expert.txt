 You are given two strings $A$ and $B$. First you need to choose a subset $S$ of the set $\{0, 1, \ldots, N-1\}$. Then for each $x \in S$, you need to choose the smallest alphabetically smallest character among $A_x$. Replace $A_x$ by that character. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. - The second line contains a single string $A$. - The third line contains a single string $B$. -----Output----- For each test case: - If it is impossible to convert $A$ to $B$, print a single line containing the integer $-1$. - Otherwise, first, print a line containing a single integer $K$ ― the minimum number of operations. - Then, print $K$ lines describing the operations. Each of these lines should contain a positive integer $Z$, followed by a space and $Z$ pairwise distinct space-separated integers from the set $\{0, 1, \ldots, N-1\}$ ― the elements of $S$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 20$ - $1 \le N \le 10^3$ - $|A| = |B| = N$ - $A$ and $B$ contain only lowercase English letters -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (30 points): $B$ contains only characters 'a' and 'b' Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 3 5 abcab aabab 3 aaa aab 2 de cd -----Example Output----- 2 3 1 2 4 3 0 1 3 -1 -1 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: - First, we can choose $S = (1, 2, 4)$, so the character $c$ is 'b' and the string $A$ after this operation is "abbab". - Then, we choose $S = (0, 1, 3)$, so $c$ is 'a', and $A$ becomes "aabab". - There is no way to convert $A$ to $B$ in only one operation. Example case 2: We can see that it is impossible to convert $A$ to $B$ since $c$ is always 'a'. Example case 3: We can see again that it is impossible to convert $A$ to $B$ since $c$ cannot be 'c'.
