 On a table are N cards, with a positive integer printed on the front and back of each card (possibly different). We flip any number of cards, and after we choose one card.  If the number X on the back of the chosen card is not on the front of any card, then this number X is good. What is the smallest number that is good   If no number is good, output 0. Here, fronts[i] and backs[i] represent the number on the front and back of card i.  A flip swaps the front and back numbers, so the value on the front is now on the back and vice versa. Example: Input: fronts = [1,2,4,
