 Given a string s, return the maximum number of ocurrences of any substring under the following rules: The number of unique characters in the substring must be less than or equal to maxLetters. The substring size must be between minSize and maxSize inclusive.   Example 1: Input: s = "aababcaab", maxLetters = 2, minSize = 3, maxSize = 4 Output: 2 Explanation: Substring "aab" has 2 ocurrences in the original string
