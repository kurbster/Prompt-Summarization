Let's consider a rooted binary tree with the following properties:
- The number of nodes and edges in the tree is infinite
- The tree root is labeled by $1$
- A node labeled by $v$ has two children: $2 \cdot v$ (the left child of $v$), and $2 \cdot v + 1$ (the right child of $v$).
Here is an image of the first several layers of such a tree:

Let's consider four operations that you are allowed to apply during the tree traversal:
- move to the left child - move from $v$ to $2 \cdot v$
- move to the right child - move from $v$ to $2 \cdot v + 1$
- move to the parent as a left child - move from $v$ to $\frac{v}{2}$ if $v$ is an even integer
- move to the parent as a right child - move from $v$ to $\frac{v - 1}{2}$ if $v$ is an odd integer
It can be proven, that for any pair of nodes $u$ and $v$, there is only one sequence of commands that moves from $u$ to $v$ and visits each node of the tree at most once. Let's call such a sequence of commands a path configuration for a pair of nodes $(u, v)$.
You are asked to process a series of the following queries: 
You are given three integers $n$, $u$ and $v$ ($1 \leq u, v \leq n$). Count the pairs of nodes $(w, t)$ ($1 \leq w, t \leq n$) such that the path configuration for $(w, t)$ is the same with the path configuration for $(u, v)$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer $Q$, denoting the number of queries to process.
- Each of the next $Q$ lines contains three space-separated integers $n$, $u$ and $v$ denoting a query.

-----Output-----
For each query, print the answer on a separate line.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq Q \leq 2 \cdot 10^4$
- $1 \leq u, v \leq n \leq 10^{9}$

-----Example Input-----
3
11 9 11
10 2 2
8 1 8

-----Example Output-----
2
10
1

-----Explanation-----
In the first query from the example test case, you should count pairs $(5, 7)$ and $(9, 11)$.
In the second query from the example test case, you should count the following pairs: $(1, 1)$, $(2, 2)$, $(3, 3)$, $(4, 4)$, $(5, 5)$, $(6, 6)$, $(7, 7)$, $(8, 8)$, $(9, 9)$ and $(10, 10)$.
In the third query from the example test case, you should only count a pair $(1, 8)$.
