Chef is playing a game with his brother Chefu. He asked Chefu to choose a positive integer $N$, multiply it by a given integer $A$, then choose a divisor of $N$ (possibly $N$ itself) and add it to the product. Let's denote the resulting integer by $M$; more formally, $M = A \cdot N + d$, where $d$ is some divisor of $N$.
Chefu told Chef the value of $M$ and now, Chef should guess $N$. Help him find all values of $N$ which Chefu could have chosen.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $M$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print two lines. The first line should contain a single integer $C$ denoting the number of possible values of $N$. The second line should contain $C$ space-separated integers denoting all possible values of $N$ in increasing order.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $C$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^7$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $2 \le M \le 10^{10}$
- $1 \le A < M$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (50 points):
- $M \le 10^6$
Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints
