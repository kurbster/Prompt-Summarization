 Design a data structure that supports all following operations in average O(1) time. insert(val): Inserts an item val to the set if not already present. remove(val): Removes an item val from the set if present. getRandom: Returns a random element from current set of elements. Each element must have the same probability of being returned. Example: // Init an empty set. RandomizedSet randomSet = new RandomizedSet(); // Inserts 1 to the set. Returns true as 1 was inserted successfully. randomSet.
