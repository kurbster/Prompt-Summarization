 Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence. A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order. Examples: Input: [1,7,4,9,2,5] Output: 6 The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence. Input: [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8] Output: 7 There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,
