 You are given K eggs and you have access to a building with N floors from 1 to N.  Each egg is identical in function, and if an egg breaks, you cannot drop it again. You know that there exists a floor F with 0 <= F <= N such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than F will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor F will not break. Each move, you may take an egg (if you have an unbroken one) and drop it from any floor X (with 1 <= X <= N).  Your goal is to determine with certainty what the value of F is.
