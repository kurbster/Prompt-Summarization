A bus has n stops numbered from 0 to n - 1 that form a circle. We know the distance between all pairs of neighboring stops where distancei is the distance between the stops number i and (i + 1) % n.The bus goes along both directions i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise.Return the shortest distance between the given start and destination stops. Example 1:Input: distance = 1,2,3,4, start = 0, destination = 1Output: 1Explanation: Distance between 0 and 1 is 1 or 9, minimum is 1. Example 2:Input: distance = 1,2,3,4, start = 0, destination = 2Output: 3Explanation: Distance between 0 and 2 is 3 or 7, minimum is 3. Example 3:Input: distance = 1,2,3,4, start = 0, destination = 3Output: 4Explanation: Distance between 0 and 3 is 6 or 4, minimum is 4. Constraints:1 <= n <= 10^4distance.length == n0 <= start, destination < n0 <= distancei <= 10^4
