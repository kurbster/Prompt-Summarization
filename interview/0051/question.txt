There are n games in a football tournament. Three teams are participating in it. Currently k games had already been played. 

You are an avid football fan, but recently you missed the whole k games. Fortunately, you remember a guess of your friend for these k games. Your friend did not tell exact number of wins of each team, instead he thought that absolute difference between number of wins of first and second team will be d_1 and that of between second and third team will be d_2.

You don't want any of team win the tournament, that is each team should have the same number of wins after n games. That's why you want to know: does there exist a valid tournament satisfying the friend's guess such that no team will win this tournament?

Note that outcome of a match can not be a draw, it has to be either win or loss.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer corresponding to number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5).

Each of the next t lines will contain four space-separated integers n, k, d_1, d_2 (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^12; 0 ≤ k ≤ n; 0 ≤ d_1, d_2 ≤ k) — data for the current test case.


-----Output-----

For each test case, output a single line containing either "yes" if it is possible to have no winner of tournament, or "no" otherwise (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
3 0 0 0
3 3 0 0
6 4 1 0
6 3 3 0
3 3 3 2

Output
yes
yes
yes
no
no



-----Note-----

Sample 1. There has not been any match up to now (k = 0, d_1 = 0, d_2 = 0). If there will be three matches (1-2, 2-3, 3-1) and each team wins once, then at the end each team will have 1 win.

Sample 2. You missed all the games (k = 3). As d_1 = 0 and d_2 = 0, and there is a way to play three games with no winner of tournament (described in the previous sample), the answer is "yes".

Sample 3. You missed 4 matches, and d_1 = 1, d_2 = 0. These four matches can be: 1-2 (win 2), 1-3 (win 3), 1-2 (win 1), 1-3 (win 1). Currently the first team has 2 wins, the second team has 1 win, the third team has 1 win. Two remaining matches can be: 1-2 (win 2), 1-3 (win 3). In the end all the teams have equal number of wins (2 wins).
