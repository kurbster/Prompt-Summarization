You are given $n$ different binary words. A word is called binary if it contains only characters '0' and '1'. You want to order the words such that the first character of a word matches the last character of the previous word. If you cannot put the words in that order then you can reverse some words so that: the final set of $n$ words still contains different words; there is a way to put all words of the final set of words in the order specified. Input: The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases in the input. Then $t$ test cases follow. The first line of a test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5$) — the number of words in the list. Next $n$ lines contain these words. The sum of word lengths doesn't exceed $4\cdot10^6$. All words are different. Output: Print answer for all of $t$ test cases in the order they appear. If there is no answer for the test case, print -1. Otherwise, the first line of the output should contain $k$ ($0 \le k \le n$) — the minimal number of words in the set which should be reversed. The second line of the output should contain $k$ distinct integers — the indexes of the words in the set which should be reversed. Words are numerated from $1$ to $n$ in the order they appear. If $k=0$ you can skip this line (or you can print an empty line). If there are many answers you can print any of them. -----Example----- Input 4 4 0001 1000 0011 0111 3 010 101 0 2 00000 00001 4 01 001 0001 00001 Output 1 3 -1 0 2 1 2
